**Surgery‑contraindicated or high‑risk surgical sites** | The patient has comorbidities that increase surgical risk (e.g., severe immunosuppression, poor wound healing) or the tumor sits in a functionally or cosmetically sensitive area (face, ear, eye, scalp) where excision would cause significant morbidity or disfigurement. | Definitive external‑beam or superficial radiation is used to control the lesion while preserving the surrounding structures. |\n| **Adjuvant after incomplete surgical excision** | If a wide local margin cannot be achieved or a microscopic focus of tumor remains, radiation can reduce the chance of local recurrence, especially for high‑risk BCCs (large size, aggressive histology, ulceration, perineural invasion, or recurrent disease). | Typically low‑dose, fractionated external‑beam therapy delivered over several weeks. |\n| **Recurrent or in‑situ BCC** | Recurrent tumors that have failed previous surgeries may be amenable to radiation, offering a non‑invasive option that can eradicate residual cells. | Often delivered as targeted external beam or brachytherapy, depending on depth and location. |\n| **Patients with poor healing or contraindications to anesthesia** | For patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia or who have compromised cutaneous integrity (e.g., due to chronic ulcers or extensive prior radiation), radiation can be an outpatient, non‑surgical alternative. | Outpatient radiation sessions with careful planning to spare healthy tissue. |\n\n**Key Points**  \n- **BCC is usually cured by surgical excision**, but radiation therapy is a valuable tool when surgery is not feasible or when additional control is desired.  \n- The decision is guided by tumor characteristics (size, depth, histology) and patient factors (overall health, cosmetic priorities, previous treatments).  \n- Radiation may be used **de‑facto as the main treatment** (definitive) or **adjuvantly after surgery** to minimize

Red or blond hair is a sign of **fair skin**, a well‑established risk factor for basal cell carcinoma. Fair‑skinned individuals have less melanin, the pigment that protects skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Because UV exposure is the primary driver of BCC, people with red or blond hair are more susceptible to the DNA damage that can lead to this disease.\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Fair skin and light hair** (including red or blond) are mentioned explicitly as a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.  \n- The increased risk is due to lower melanin levels, providing less natural protection against UV radiation.  \n- Other related risk factors include sun exposure, indoor tanning, and a history of skin cancer, but hair color is an easy‑to‑identify indicator of fair skin.\n\n### Practical implication\n\nIf you have red or blond hair, it’s wise to take preventive measures such as:\n\n- Regular skin examinations for early detection.\n- Limiting sun exposure and using broad‑spectrum sunscreen.\n- Avoiding indoor tanning and protecting skin with clothing or hats.\n\nEarly detection and prevention can significantly improve outcomes for BCC.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",
