    "question_type": "Fact Retrieval",
    "generated_answer": "Stomach cancer is a malignant tumor that develops within the lining of the stomach wall. The vast majority of these cancers are **adenocarcinomas**, which arise from the mucus‑producing glandular cells of the stomach’s mucosa.  \n\n- **Origin:** The cancer originates in the innermost mucosa layer (the epithelial surface of the stomach) and then infiltrates outward through the deeper layers—the submucosa, muscularis, and possibly into the subserosa and serosa.  \n- **Progression:** When the tumor has not invaded beyond the mucosa and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is considered early‑stage. If it penetrates deeper layers or involves regional lymph nodes, it is classified as locoregional or locally advanced. Once the cancer reaches lymph nodes, distant organs (such as the liver, peritoneum, lungs, or bone) or the bloodstream, it is deemed *metastatic* stomach cancer.  \n- **Symptoms and detection:** Early changes often occur without noticeable symptoms. As the disease progresses, patients may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or bleeding. Diagnostic tools include endoscopy, biopsy, imaging studies, and blood tests (e.g., tumor markers).  \n- **Treatment considerations:** Management depends on the stage, but may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or a combination. Early‑stage disease may be curable with surgery alone, whereas metastatic disease typically requires systemic therapy to control disease spread.  \n\nThese points summarize the nature, origin, progression, and clinical context of stomach cancer.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",

    "question_type": "Complex Reasoning",
    "generated_answer": "**Why annual full‑skin examinations are essential for people who have had basal cell carcinoma (BCC)**  \n\n1. **Early detection of recurrence or new primary lesions**  \n   BCC can recur at the original site or arise as a new lesion elsewhere on the skin. Because the majority of BCCs are locally invasive and can be cured when identified early, a routine, full‑body skin exam gives a high chance of spotting a new or regrown tumor before it becomes large, ulcerated, or requires more extensive surgery【1】.  \n\n2. **Guideline‑based surveillance**  \n   The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends regular skin checks for all patients who have completed treatment for any skin cancer, including BCC. Annual visits—especially after the first few years post‑treatment—align with NCCN’s schedule for “high‑risk” skin‑cancer survivors, ensuring that any change is captured promptly【1】.  \n\n3. **Simpler management when issues are caught early**  \n   If a recurrence or a second BCC appears while still small, it can usually be excised with a single, local procedure. Delaying detection often increases the size or depth of the lesion, sometimes necessitating wider excision margins, adjuvant therapy, or more invasive treatments. Early intervention, therefore, preserves skin integrity and reduces morbidity.  \n\n4. **Comprehensive care for patients with multiple risk factors**  \n   Many individuals who develop BCC share several risk factors—older age, fair skin, chronic sun exposure—that increase the likelihood of future skin‑cancer events. Annual full‑skin exams allow clinicians to monitor the entire integumentary system for other skin‑cancer types (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma) that may develop in the same high‑risk population.  \n\n**Bottom line** – Annual, full‑body skin exams are a cornerstone of post‑treatment surveillance for BCC patients because they provide the best opportunity to catch new or recurring tumors when they are most treatable, thereby preserving skin health and improving long‑term outcomes.\n\n### References  \n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",

    "evidence": "Colonoscopy is recommended for surveillance after rectal cancer surgery.; Colonoscopy is especially important in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).; Patients with FAP have a high risk of polyps.",
    "question_type": "Complex Reasoning",
    "generated_answer": "Colonoscopy is a key part of the surveillance plan after rectal‑cancer surgery because it lets clinicians look for new polyps or early‑stage cancers that can develop in the remaining colon.  Most rectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, and removing these polyps before they become malignant can prevent a second cancer from forming – the same technique that is routinely used during a colonoscopy 【1】.  In addition, a colonoscopy provides a visual and histologic assessment that can reveal early recurrence of disease in the proximal colon, which might otherwise be missed on routine imaging 【1】.\n\nAnother reason for post‑operative colonoscopy is to monitor for metachronous (separate) cancers that appear after the initial rectal lesion is excised.  Patients who have had a rectal cancer already carry a higher baseline risk for a second primary colon cancer, so regular colonoscopic evaluation helps catch any new lesions while they are still confined to the mucosa or submucosa 【1】.\n\nCertain patient characteristics amplify the value of this surveillance.  A mismatch‑repair deficiency (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability (MSI‑H) phenotype—often associated with Lynch syndrome—significantly increases the risk of synchronous or late‑onset colon cancers.  When a rectal tumor is found to be dMMR/MSI‑H, clinicians typically recommend more intensive colonoscopic surveillance because of the heightened likelihood of additional polyps or cancers developing in the colon 【1】.  Likewise, a strong family history of colorectal cancer or germline conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) also makes post‑operative colonoscopy especially crucial 【1】.\n\n### References  \n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",

It is considered a *pre‑cancer* lesion. | \n| **Detection** | HSIL is identified on routine cervical screening (Pap smear or HPV testing).

    "generated_answer": "The discovery of a lung nodule on imaging sets in motion a structured, multidisciplinary workflow designed to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant and, if cancer is present, to establish stage and guide treatment. The typical steps are:\n\n| Step | What happens | Who is involved | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **Risk assessment** | Review the patient’s age, smoking history, occupational exposures, and family history to calculate the probability of malignancy. | Pulmonologist, thoracic radiologist, nurse navigator | Helps decide how aggressively to investigate the nodule. |\n| **Imaging review** | The radiologist assesses the nodule’s size, shape, borders, density, and growth rate on prior scans or a repeat CT. | Thoracic radiologist, sometimes a thoracic surgeon | Determines if imaging alone can rule out cancer or if further work‑up is needed. |\n| **Multidisciplinary discussion** | A “lung‑nodule‑expert” team (pulmonologist, thoracic radiologist, thoracic surgeon, sometimes a pathologist) evaluates the risk assessment and imaging findings, often in an institutional tumor‑board setting. | Team of experts | Provides a consensus plan—whether to observe, to obtain additional imaging, or to proceed to tissue sampling. |\n| **Decision to biopsy** | If the nodule meets size or growth criteria (e.g., >8 mm, rapid growth, spiculated margins) or if risk assessment is high, a tissue sample is obtained.  Common approaches: CT‑guided core needle biopsy, ultrasound‑guided fine‑needle aspiration, or surgical (video‑assisted thoracoscopic) biopsy. | Interventional radiologist, thoracic surgeon, pulmonologist | Biopsy supplies the only definitive evidence of malignancy and allows histologic subtyping. |\n| **Pathology and staging** | The biopsy specimen is examined by a pathologist; immunohistochemistry and molecular testing may be performed. The result informs cancer type, stage, and potential targeted therapies. | Pathologist, oncologist | Determines treatment strategy—surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or surveillance. |\n| **Follow‑up plan** | For benign or low‑risk nodules, the team schedules periodic CT surveillance per NCCN guidelines (e.g., 6 months, 12 months, then annually). For malignant nodules, a full staging work‑up (PET‑CT, brain MRI, bone scan) follows and treatment is begun. | Entire care team | Allows early detection of recurrence or spread and ensures timely intervention. |\n\n#### Key points  \n- The presence of a lung nodule does **not** automatically mean cancer; most nodules are benign.  \n- A systematic approach—risk stratification, imaging review, expert discussion, and, if indicated, biopsy—is required to avoid unnecessary procedures while ensuring early cancer detection.  \n- The multidisciplinary “lung‑nodule experts” model optimizes decision‑making, reduces delays, and improves patient outcomes.\n\n### References  \n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: \n",

Early detection dramatically improves survival rates, yet many at‑risk individuals do not receive timely screening. By understanding the key risk factors and following evidence‑based screening guidelines, you can take control of your health and protect your future.  \n\n---\n\n#### 1. Know Your Risk Factors  \nCertain factors increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer. They are not guarantees of disease, but they help determine when and how often you should be screened.  \n\n| Risk Factor | Why It Matters | What to Do |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|\n| **Age** – Women over 50 are at higher risk. | Age is a strong, non‑modifiable factor. | Begin regular screening earlier if you belong to a high‑risk group. |\n| **Family History** – Relatives (especially first‑degree) with breast or ovarian cancer. | Shared genetics raise risk. | Consider genetic counseling or earlier screening. |\n| **Personal Genetics** – BRCA1/BRCA2 and other hereditary mutations. | Directly influences cancer likelihood. | Discuss risk‑reduction strategies with your clinician. |\n| **Reproductive History** – Late first pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, no breastfeeding. | Hormonal exposures affect breast tissue. | Review hormone therapy with your doctor; consider breast‑feeding when possible. |\n| **Lifestyle** – Alcohol, obesity, limited physical activity. | Modifiable risk factors that can be changed. | Adopt a balanced diet, limit alcohol, and maintain regular exercise. |\n\n*(All facts drawn from clinical evidence and NCCN recommendations. See reference [1]).*  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. Follow the Screening Recommendations  \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides clear guidance that has become the gold standard for clinicians and patients alike.  \n\n- **Women 55–74** – Annual mammography (recommended by NCCN Guidelines for Patients).  \n- **Women 40–54** – Bi‑annual mammography (if you choose or have higher risk).  \n- **High‑risk individuals** (<40, family history, genetic mutations) – Consider earlier screening, possibly with MRI plus mammography.  \n- **Breast self‑exam** – Perform monthly to spot any new lumps or changes.  \n\nAll recommendations emphasize that *early detection through regular, age‑appropriate screening is the most effective way to improve outcomes.*  \n\n*(These points reflect NCCN evidence‑based guidelines; see reference [1]).*  \n\n---\n\n#### 3.

Surveillance & Follow‑up Schedule  \n\n| Time Point | Test | Purpose | Action if Abnormal |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **6–12 months** | Physical examination; Blood tests (TSH, Thyroglobulin [Tg], Anti‑Tg antibodies) | Assess biochemical remission; detect early recurrence | If Tg > 1 ng/mL or rising trend → schedule neck ultrasound and consider additional imaging |\n| | Neck ultrasound | Visualize residual thyroid bed and nodal basin | If suspicious lesions → referral for biopsy or further imaging |\n| **After RAI therapy** (if administered) | Whole‑body RAI scan | Identify residual or metastatic disease | Positive uptake → repeat RAI or additional therapy |\n| **Long‑term (≥ 2 years)** | Annual physical exam; Quarterly blood tests (TSH, Tg, Tg‑ab) | Maintain monitoring in the no‑evidence‑of‑disease (NED) phase; prompt detection of late recurrence | Same algorithm as above |\n\n**Notes**  \n- Tg is produced only by thyroid tissue; in the absence of normal thyroid, any detectable Tg suggests residual disease.  \n- Anti‑Tg antibodies can interfere with Tg measurement; a significant rise in anti‑Tg antibodies can also indicate disease activity.  \n- Neck ultrasound frequency may be increased (e.g., every 3–6 months) if Tg levels rise or are persistently above the expected range.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Red‑Flag Symptoms to Report Immediately  \n- New or worsening neck swelling or pain  \n- Hoarseness or voice changes  \n- Difficulty swallowing or breathing  \n- Unexplained weight loss or fatigue  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Lifestyle & Education  \n- **Medication Adherence**: Take levothyroxine on an empty stomach, 30–60 minutes before breakfast.  \n- **Avoid Interfering Foods/Others**: Calcium, iron supplements, or large meals should be separated from medication.  \n- **Follow‑up Appointments**: Keep all scheduled visits; bring a current medication list and any lab results.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Contact Information  \n- **Primary Care / Endocrine**: [Clinic Name], Phone: [number]  \n- **Surgical Team**: [Surgeon Name], Phone: [number]  \n- **Urgent Symptoms**: Call 911 or go to nearest emergency department.  \n\n---  \n\n**References**  \n\n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",

According to clinical practice guidelines, the recommended diagnostic steps include further characterization of the lesion with contrast-enhanced imaging, such as MRI or CT, to assess for radiologic features typical of HCC. Measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is also advised, as elevated or rising AFP levels may support the diagnosis, though not all HCCs are AFP-secreting.

A comprehensive physical examination should evaluate lymph node regions, spleen, and liver for enlargement. Laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and beta-2 microglobulin. The definitive diagnosis requires an excisional lymph node biopsy for histopathological evaluation, including immunophenotyping to confirm B-cell lineage and to assess for characteristic markers such as BCL2 overexpression or t(14;18) translocation. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are performed to determine marrow involvement. Imaging studies, such as CT or PET-CT, are used to assess the extent of nodal and extranodal disease. The pathologist will grade FL based on the proportion of centrocytes and centroblasts: grades 1 and 2 are considered classic FL, grade 3A is intermediate, and grade 3B is managed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This grading is essential for guiding management decisions. In patients without B symptoms and with low tumor burden, observation may be appropriate, as not all require immediate therapy.

Prevention Strategies\n\n| Strategy | Action | Why it Matters |\n|---|---|---|\n| **HPV Vaccination** | Get the 9‑valent HPV vaccine (recommended for people up to 45 years). | Prevents the high‑risk HPV strains (notably HPV‑16) that cause the majority of anal cancers. |  \n| **Safe Sex Practices** | Use condoms or dental dams; limit number of sexual partners. | Reduces transmission of HPV and other sexually transmitted infections that raise anal cancer risk. |  \n| **Smoking Cessation** | Join local quit‑lines or counseling programs. | Smoking increases the risk of anal cancer and worsens treatment outcomes. |  \n| **Avoid Immunosuppressive Drugs (when possible)** | Discuss alternatives with your physician. | Immunosuppressants heighten the chance of HPV persistence and anal cancer. |  \n\nAll prevention efforts should be reinforced through community education, workplace health programs, and routine primary‑care visits.  \n‑[1]\n\n## 3. Key Risk Factors\n\n| Risk Factor | Who it Affects | How it Increases Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection** | Everyone sexually active; higher in MSM, HIV‑positive individuals. | Chronic infection can evolve into precancerous lesions and then cancer. |\n| **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** | People living with HIV, especially those with low CD4 counts. | Impaired immunity allows persistent HPV infection. |\n| **Smoking** | All adult smokers. | Carcinogens in tobacco promote genetic mutations in anal tissue. |\n| **Immunosuppression / Transplant medications** | Organ‑transplant recipients, long‑term steroid users. | Suppressed immune surveillance permits HPV persistence. |\n| **History of anal, cervical, vulvar, or vaginal dysplasia** | Individuals with prior precancerous lesions. | Indicates a susceptibility to abnormal cell growth. |\n| **Age ≥ 50** | Older adults. | Risk rises with age due to cumulative exposures. |\n| **Family history of HPV‑related cancers** | Relatives with anal, cervical, or oropharyngeal cancers. | Genetic predisposition increases likelihood. |\n\nRecognizing these factors helps identify individuals who should be prioritized for screening.  \n‑[1]\n\n## 4. Early Detection & Screening\n\n| Screening Modality | Who should get it | Frequency (typical) | What it involves |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)** | All adults; more frequent for high‑risk groups | Every 3–6 months for 5 years after treatment; yearly for those with a history of dysplasia | A clinician gently inserts a finger to feel for lumps or abnormalities. |\n| **High‑Resolution Anoscopy (HRA)** | MSM, HIV‑positive persons, those with a history of anal dysplasia | As recommended by a specialist; often at baseline and annually | Uses magnification and acetic acid to visualize abnormal tissue; biopsies are taken if needed. |\n| **Biopsy** | Any suspicious lesion detected by DRE or HRA | Immediately upon detection | Tissue sample examined microscopically to confirm cancer. |\n| **Surveillance After Treatment** | All anal cancer survivors | DRE and lymph‑node exams every 3–6 months for 5 years; anoscopy 6–12 months per year for 3 years; imaging annually for stage II–III | Detects recurrence early. |\n| **Annual Health Exams** | All adults, especially over 50 | 1 year | Allows primary‑care providers to discuss anal cancer risks and screening options. |\n\nEarly detection dramatically improves treatment options and survival.  \n‑[1]\n\n## 5. Recommendations for High‑Risk Populations\n\n| Population | Specific Actions |\n|---|---|\n| **Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM)** | • Receive HPV vaccination if not yet fully vaccinated.<br>• Undergo HRA annually (or more often if a lesion is found).<br>• Quit smoking and use condoms. |\n| **HIV‑Positive Individuals** | • Maintain antiretroviral therapy to keep CD4 high.<br>• Get HRA and DRE per guidelines, at least annually.<br>• Discuss smoking cessation and vaccination. |\n| **Transplant Recipients / Long‑term Immunosuppression** | • Discuss with transplant team about reduced immunosuppression when possible.<br>• Annual HRA and DRE.<br>• HPV vaccination may still be beneficial. |\n| **People with Prior Anal/Cervical Dysplasia** | • Schedule follow‑up HRA every 6–12 months.<br>• Be alert to bleeding or itching; seek prompt evaluation. |\n| **Older Adults (≥ 50) with No Prior Screening** | • Discuss with primary‑care provider about DRE and HRA.<br>• Evaluate smoking history and consider cessation resources. |\n\n### Community Outreach\n\n- **Workshops & Clinics**: Offer free or low‑cost HPV vaccination and screening events at community centers, churches, and LGBTQ+ organizations.  \n- **Information Campaign**: Distribute flyers and digital media highlighting signs (rectal bleeding, itching), risk factors, and the importance of early detection.  \n- **Collaborations**: Partner with local STD clinics, HIV/AIDS service organizations, and transplant centers to coordinate high‑resolution anoscopy services.  \n\n## 6. Resources & Support\n\n- **Anal Cancer Foundation** – Peer‑to‑Peer Support Program (contact: connect@analcancerfoundation.org).  \n- **Local Health Department Hotline** – 1‑800‑XXX‑XXXX (24 / 7) for questions about screening and HPV vaccination.  \n- **Free Smoking Cessation Programs** – Available through primary‑care clinics and community health centers.  \n- **HPV Vaccination Clinics** – Scheduled during flu‑shot drives and annual health fairs.  \n\n---  \n\n### References  \n\n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1  \n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1  \n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1  \n\n*(The same source is cited repeatedly to reference the multiple statements and recommendations above.)*",
    "ground_truth": "Community Health Advisory: Anal Cancer Prevention and Early Detection\n\nAnal cancer is a rare but increasingly diagnosed disease, with certain populations at higher risk. The most significant risk factor is persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly high-risk strains such as HPV16. Other important risk factors include HIV infection, use of immunosuppressant medications (such as after organ transplantation), a history of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal cancer or precancer, previous anal dysplasia (including anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL], or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]), smoking, a history of anal sex, and certain autoimmune disorders or blood cancers.\n\nPrevention strategies include receiving the HPV vaccine, which protects against several high-risk HPV strains and is most effective when administered before exposure to the virus. The vaccine is recommended for adolescents and young adults, and may be considered for adults up to age 45. Smoking cessation is also strongly advised, as smoking increases the risk of anal and other cancers. Maintaining a healthy immune system and practicing safe sexual behaviors can further reduce risk.\n\nEarly detection is critical. Common early symptoms of anal cancer include rectal bleeding, anal itching, pain, or the presence of a lump or mass near the anus. These symptoms are sometimes mistaken for benign conditions such as hemorrhoids, so prompt medical evaluation is important. High-risk individuals—such as those with HIV, immunosuppression, or a history of HPV-related cancers or precancerous lesions—should undergo regular screening with digital rectal examination (DRE) and anoscopy as recommended by their healthcare provider. Identifying and treating precancerous lesions (anal dysplasia) can prevent progression to cancer.\n\nIf you have any of the above risk factors or symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation and to discuss appropriate screening and prevention measures."

Early recognition of risk factors, timely screening, and prompt evaluation of symptoms can dramatically improve outcomes.  The advisory below summarizes evidence‑based guidelines and practical steps that residents can take to protect themselves and their families from lung cancer.  \n\n---\n\n## 2 Key Risk Factors  \n- **Tobacco Smoke & Second‑hand Smoke** – the primary and most well‑documented causes of lung cancer; risk rises with the number of cigarettes and duration of exposure.  \n- **Environmental Exposures** – radon, asbestos, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, coal smoke, soot, silica, diesel fumes, fine particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide all increase risk.  \n- **Lifestyle & Demographics** – older age, obesity, and a family history of prostate or bladder cancer add to overall vulnerability.  \n\n*These factors underline the importance of smoking cessation, radon testing, and occupational safety measures.*  [1]  \n\n---\n\n## 3 Screening Recommendations  \n| Population | Recommended Screening | Frequency |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Adults **50–80 years** with a history of **≥20 pack‑years** smoking (including former smokers who quit ≤15 years ago) | Low‑dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest | Every **year** if the previous scan is normal |\n| Former smokers who quit >15 years ago, or who have fewer pack‑years | Clinical evaluation; LDCT may be considered based on clinical judgment | As directed by the treating clinician |\n| Never‑smokers with no known risk factors | Routine screening not recommended | — |\n\n> *LDCT screening is most effective when performed in high‑risk individuals and has been shown to reduce lung‑cancer mortality.*  [1]  \n\n**Take‑away:** If you fall into a high‑risk category, discuss LDCT screening with your primary care provider or a pulmonary specialist.  \n\n---\n\n## 4 Symptom Awareness  \nBe alert for the following signs, especially if you are in a high‑risk group or have begun to smoke cessation:\n\n- Persistent cough that does not improve or worsens over weeks  \n- New or worsening chest pain or shortness of breath  \n- Hoarseness or voice changes  \n- Unexplained weight loss or fatigue  \n- Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)  \n- Recurrent pneumonia or respiratory infections  \n\nIf any of these symptoms occur, seek medical evaluation promptly; early intervention can be life‑saving.  [1]  \n\n---\n\n## 5 Prevention Strategies  \n| Action | Description | Why it matters |\n|--------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Quit smoking** | Use counseling, medication, or nicotine replacement as offered by health care services | Eliminates the single largest risk factor |\n| **Avoid second‑hand smoke** | Keep indoor spaces smoke‑free and advise household members | Reduces passive exposure |\n| **Test home radon levels** | Use a radon test kit; repair if levels are high | Radon is a major indoor carcinogen |\n| **Occupational safety** | Use protective equipment and follow industry safety protocols | Minimizes inhalation of carcinogenic dusts and fumes |\n| **Maintain healthy weight** | Combine balanced diet with regular exercise | Lowers overall cancer risk |\n| **Stay informed** | Keep updated on NCCN patient guides and local public‑health resources | Enables proactive health‑care decisions |\n\n---  \n\n## 6 Get Involved  \n- **Participate in local smoking‑cessation programs** – many are offered at no cost through clinics and community centers.  \n- **Share lung‑cancer information** with family and friends, especially those in high‑risk categories.  \n- **Advocate for cleaner indoor environments** by supporting policies that limit radon and improve indoor air quality.  \n\n---  \n\n### References  \n\n- [1] Document Name: Medical, Page Number: 1",
    "ground_truth": "Community Health Advisory: Preventing and Detecting Lung Cancer Early\n\nLung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common type. The primary risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco smoking, but exposure to secondhand smoke, radon, asbestos, air pollution, and certain occupational hazards (such as diesel fumes) also increase risk. While anyone can develop lung cancer, individuals with a history of heavy smoking or significant exposure to these risk factors are at higher risk and should discuss lung cancer screening with their healthcare provider. Screening, such as low-dose CT scans, is recommended for those at high risk and can detect lung cancer at an early, more treatable stage—often before symptoms appear. Early symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or unexplained weight loss. Quitting smoking and minimizing exposure to harmful substances are the most effective ways to reduce your risk. Regular checkups, updating your healthcare provider on your family and exposure history, and being aware of new or persistent respiratory symptoms are important for early detection. Participation in clinical trials and supportive care services may also improve outcomes for those diagnosed with lung cancer."
