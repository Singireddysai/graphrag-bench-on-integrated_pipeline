Abstract

=== Page 3 - main_text ===
Roller compaction is a key unit operation in a dry granulation line for pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing. However, determining the optimal settings for a roller compactor (RC) typically requires extensive material-consuming experimental campaigns. This amount of material, in particular if active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved, may not be available during development phases, or may be very expensive. For this reason, a compactor simulator (CS) is usually employed to emulate the behaviour of compacted powders at a much smaller scale, with significant savings of materials, time, and money. However, the experimental conditions at which a CS shall be run to obtain a product with assigned specifications are different from those required to obtain the same product from a full-scale RC. How to find these conditions is an open issue. In this study, historical data from both CS and RC experiments are used to develop a transfer methodology that allows the experimenter to obtain optimal RC setup from the CS experimental results solely. The developed correlation, which has been applied to six different pharmaceutical powder blends, successfully captures the differences between the two equipment scales. Implementing this transfer methodology can result in reliable prediction of RC machine settings, thus enabling significant resource, time and money savings.

process flowability properties of pharmaceutical powder blends in the manufacturing of tablets. It is a continuous process that involves feeding powder through a pair of counter-rotating rollers, which compact it into a solid mass known as ribbon by exerting pressure. To better understand the phenomena that occur during the compaction process, Johanson (1965) developed a powder mechanics model that predicted the roll surface pressure and the ribbon solid fraction based on the physical properties of the powdered material, the operating conditions and the roller compactor (RC) geometry. To utilize the Johanson model, which presents two material- dependent parameters, it is required a calibration of the latter by performing a parameter estimation employing RC experimental results of a specific powder blend. However, performing a comprehensive experimental campaign on the RC demands significant amounts of material, including very expensive active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which may not be available during the drug development phases. In this context, compaction simulators (CSs) have been developed, which mimic the roll compaction process by performing uniaxial compaction through two counter-moving punches. By employing a CS, it became possible to quantify the compaction behaviour of a specific powder blend through more resource-efficient experimental campaigns, involving material amounts on the order of grams compared to the kilograms required for the RC testing. However, the results obtained from the CS are not suitable for accurately estimating the Johanson model parameters specific to a powder mixture, owing to differences in the applied pressure for equivalent solid fraction values. In this context, Bietal., (2014) introduced the mass correction factor theory, which improves Johanson model's one-dimensional compaction assumption by providing a correction factor that allows to account

=== Page 7 - main_text ===
and link the different RC and CS pressures.

=== Page 7 - main_text ===
The objective of this Thesis is to assess the experimental results derived from both RC and CS pieces of equipment, investigating their differences across six various pharmaceutical powder blends. Following that, the analysis proceeds by developing a methodology, based on the mass correction factor theory, capable of explaining and establishing a relationship between the different CS and RC outcomes. The result, the proposed methodology allows for the characterization of the roller compaction behaviour for a specific powder blend solely by means of an experimental campaign on the CS, leading to substantial savings in terms of material, resources, and time and money.

The Chapter 2 presents the Johanson model, detailing its assumptions and benefits, as well as the physical and mathematical principles. After that, the mass correction factor theory proposed by Bi et al., (2014) is presented.

=== Page 8 - main_text ===
All materials investigated in this Thesis are presented in Chapter 3. The descriptions of all experimental campaigns conducted on both RC and CS and the related datasets follow. The mathematical methods utilised to carry out the parameter estimate for the Johanson model are next discussed. Finally, the proposed transfer methodology to establish the relationship between CS and RC pressures is described, presenting the development stage, with the calibration and validation procedures, and then the usage stage.

=== Page 8 - main_text ===
In Chapter 4, the results obtained by estimating the Johanson parameters for each powder mixture are first presented. After that, the results of the experiments derived from the two distinct pieces of equipment are compared, and an analysis of how the mass correction factor can be applied to the findings of this thesis is carried out. Consequently, a preliminary model is calibrated by utilising solely four formulations, while the remaining two are employed for the purpose of validation. The analysis of the prediction accuracy data is conducted thereafter. Following this, a comprehensive model including all six materials is developed for subsequent utilisation. A seventh powder mixture, whose CS data come from a different CS machine, is then analysed and the applicability of the transfer approach is studied. Lastly, it is examined how the composition and percentages of excipients in a powder blend affect the Johanson parameter values.

Roller Compaction is a key unit operation of the granulation line in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets. This chapter aims to present the main features of the granulation process, describing the key phenomena involved and the advantages it offers. Afterward, the roll compaction process is introduced, providing a comprehensive explanation of how powders behave during compaction. The advantages and limitations of this technology will be investigated, as well as the elementary design features of the roller compactor. Finally, the rationale and operational principles of the compactor simulator, which represents the second piece of equipment involved in this Thesis, are covered.

1.1 Introduction to the granulation process

=== Page 9 - main_text ===
Granulation is defined as a process whereby the smaller primary particles are bonded into larger secondary particles, also called agglomerates, in which the primary particles can still be identified. Because the process ultimately results in the production of a larger entity it is also known as size enlargement by agglomeration. The granulation can be performed through compressive pressure, a binding agent, or both (Parikh, 2005). Binders are substances that are added either before or after agglomeration that bind chemically or physically to the solid surfaces, creating a linkage between the particles.

=== Page 9 - main_text ===
Several different types of binding mechanisms are known that can lead to agglomeration of the primary particles: solid bridges, adhesive and cohesion forces, surface tension and capillary pressure, interlocking bonds, and attraction forces between solids. Those represent the five major groups, I to V, and within them, several subgroups of binding mechanisms can be identified, as reported in Table 1.1 (Pietsch, 2002). Pictorial representations of the aforementioned categories and subcategories are reported in Figure 1.1.

=== Page 9 - main_text ===
For the technologies and materials involved in this Thesis, the principal binding mechanisms are the ones involving powders without the presence of liquid and heating phenomena, hence groups IV and V. These kinds of forces occur when the primary particles get considerably closer to one another, usually as a result of applied pressure. In particular, Van der Waals forces, which are short-range ones, represent the main contribution to the bond of particles when those are

close enough. Given the physical nature of the involved forces, the main factors that affect the successful processing for the agglomeration of primary particles are the powder rheology and the particle size. Decreased particle size significantly improves the surface-to-mass ratio and so increases bonding interactions (Parikh, 2005).

The granulation technique has been extensively used by a variety of industries, including pharmaceutical, coal, mining, and agrochemical. These industries use agglomeration techniques to minimize dust, make the material easier to handle, and increase its ultimate utility. In the pharmaceutical industry, the granulation of powders to form structured products is one of the most important operations in the manufacturing of tablets. This type of solid oral drug represents the most widely prescribed dosage forms in use today since they are simpler to manufacture than capsules and have longer shelf life than most liquids (Peter Davies, 2016).

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
1.1.1 Rationale and benefits of granulation processes

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
There are numerous reasons for granulating pharmaceutical powder mixtures, the most important of which are listed below:

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
Improvement of flow properties. Particle size has a distinct influence on the flowability properties of powders. The enlargement of particles by granulation improves their flowability by decreasing the specific surface area and the particle-particle interaction (Schiano et al., 2018).

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
Avoiding segregation and improving content uniformity of tablets. Particle size and differences in particle density within a blend can induce segregation during the manufacturing of tablets, in particular during the die-filling process (Guo et al., 2010). This phenomenon, known as particle segregation, happens when a homogenous mixture of powder particles with varied physical attributes (such as size, density, and shape) becomes unevenly dispersed during handling and processing. Particles with identical qualities, in particular, tend to gather in a single region of the mixture, resulting in spatial non- uniformity. This can lead to false dosing of APIs dosing in the tablet. This issue is even more problematic in tablets containing low doses of API. By granulation, the mixture of the different primary particles and their percentage is fixed in the larger granules, so that an inhomogeneous distribution of the API can be prevented (Cantor et al., 2008).

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
Reduction of bulk volume. A further advantage of granulation is the size enlargement of particles which leads to a decrease in interparticle void spaces, resulting in increased bulk density of the powder. Granules occupy less space compared to loosen powders, making them easier to handle, transport, and store. This represents a great advantage in direct compression, where the high bulk volumes require high die-filling height, which can cause problems when filling the die. Furthermore, the deaeration during the compaction becomes difficult, which may result in the capping/lamination of the tablets (Mazel et al., 2015). Lastly, the reduced bulk volume also allows for more efficient packaging, which can lead to cost savings in terms of materials and storage space.

=== Page 11 - main_text ===
Reduction of safety hazards for operators. During the granulation process, the formation of larger, denser granules minimizes the generation of fine particles or dust, which are known

- Capability of controlling intermediate and product quality attributes. Within limits, granulation of pharmaceutical powder offers the advantage of allowing control over porosity, density, hardness, and surface-to-volume ratio. By adjusting the granulation process parameters such as binder concentration, granule size, and dry conditions, the porosity of the granules can be tailored. These parameters have a direct impact on the dispersibility, solubility, and reactivity of the granules, as it affects the rate of dissolution and interaction with other substances. Critical quality attributes of tablets, such as disintegration time, dissolution time, and wettability can be improved if the powder blend has been correctly granulated previously (Parikh, 2005)

Other benefits of minor importance that granulation provides include improved product appearance and a lower propensity to caking.

=== Page 12 - main_text ===
1.1.2 Granulation in the pharmaceutical industry

=== Page 12 - main_text ===
The development of pharmaceutical granulation was driven by the invention of the tablet press by W. Brockedon in 1843. Since then, numerous different granulation processes and equipment have been developed, resulting in an ongoing process of efficiency and product quality improvement. The demands on the granulation properties were further enhanced in the 1970s when high-speed tablet and capsule-filling machines with automated controls were introduced. In fact, most pharmaceutical tablets cannot be manufactured by direct compression of the formulation because of poor flowability and high segregation tendency. The high-speed compression and capsule-filling machines require a uniform flow of material to the dies or filling stations that produce pharmaceutical dosage forms. Therefore, prior to the compression step, the formulation has to go through a granulation process to improve its handling properties and to assure composition homogeneity in the final dosage form, mostly in low-dose drugs (Parikh, 2005).

=== Page 12 - main_text ===
Granulation techniques have grown in importance in drug manufacture since the most commonly used excipients and recently created APIs have low bulk density and poor flowability due to their cohesive appearance and small particle size (Szappanos-Csordas, 2018). Agglomeration technologies have played a crucial role in enabling the production of tablet drugs with a high API content, where handling and processing issues were an obstacle. Figure 1.2 illustrates where the granulation process integrates within the tablet manufacturing process. Two possible paths are possible according if wet or dry granulation is performed. Prior to granulation, all the components of the formulation are mixed. According to the properties of the powder mixture, they undergo two alternative granulation processes. But then in both cases,

The two main techniques for producing granules used in the pharmaceutical industry are wet granulation and dry granulation.

=== Page 13 - main_text ===
1.1.2.1 Wet granulation

=== Page 13 - main_text ===
Granules are formed by wetting the powder mixture with the addition of a liquid binder, such as water or organic solvents. In this case, the particles can be either directly enlarged or smaller granules formed by sieving a wet mass (Parikh, 2005). Once the granulation is performed the liquid binder is removed by means of a drying step, which aims to eliminate moisture from the granules while maintaining their integrity and desired properties. The main bonding mechanism within granules formed in wet agglomeration is liquid bridges that are formatted at the coordination points between the particles.

=== Page 13 - main_text ===
Three wet granulation techniques are used in the pharmaceutical industry: twin-screw granulation, high-shear wet granulation, and fluid bed granulation. Wet granulation is the most used granulation method in the pharmaceutical industry since the granules obtained by this process show good flow properties due to their smooth surface and narrow granule size distribution (Thapa et al., 2019).

=== Page 13 - main_text ===
Despite the benefits mentioned above, the presence of liquids (such as water or organic solvents) results in a number of drawbacks. Drying is required to remove the liquids, which

uses a lot of energy. The multi-stage process is expensive and time-consuming due to the high energy consumption and solvent recycling. The granules are also subjected to heat stress, which can accelerate the degradation process and speed up reactions like decarboxylation and oxidation (Keizer, 2021).

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
1.1.2.2 Dry granulation

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
In dry granulation, the agglomeration is achieved by means of the exertion of high pressure on the powder mixture, without the addition of any liquid or meltable binder. The powder is compacted into larger intermediate compacts, which are subsequently milled into granules. In this case, the particle size enlargement is achieved by the size reduction of previously dry compacted powder.

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
The main bonding mechanism involved in dry granulation is due to Van der Waals forces, which become dominant when the contact area between individual powder particles increases due to the applied compaction pressure (Parikh, 2005).

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
Dry agglomeration processes have been deployed in the pharmaceutical industry since the 1940s, but in the last 30 years, this technology has arisen as it offers cost-effective and delicate handling for heat and or moisture-sensitive materials since no liquid binders are needed. However, it is important to note that not all powders are suitable for dry granulation. The powder mixture must possess adequate compressibility and cohesive properties for successful compaction. The selection of appropriate excipients and the optimization of process parameters is crucial for achieving desired granule properties.

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
There are two dry granulation processes: slugging and roll compaction. Between the 1950s- 1970s slugging was the preferred method. Slugs are produced when the powder is fed into a large compression machine and compressed by tableting punches having large diameters. The slugs are milled into granules after the compression step (Parikh, 2005). Due to the lack of process control, limited economies of scale, and low manufacturing throughput associated with slugging, roll compaction developed as a preferred dry granulation method, effectively overcoming the limitations of slugging and gaining popularity in the pharmaceutical industry.

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
1.2 Roller Compactor

=== Page 14 - main_text ===
Roll compaction is a continuous dry granulation method, which first pharmaceutical application was first mentioned in 1966 by Jaminet and Hess (Kleinebudde, 2004). In agglomeration by roll compaction, mixtures of API and excipients, e.g., binders, disintegrants, diluents, and lubricants, are mixed in a blender. This powder mixture is then fed and passed through two counter-rotating rolls with the flow being induced by the friction acting at the surfaces of the rolls. In the narrow region of the gap between the rolls, the powder is subjected to high pressure, leading to the formation of a compact or briquette that is reduced in size by milling or screening,

2. The nip region: The nip, or compaction, region starts at the nip angle a, where the velocity of the powder blend starts to move with the same velocity as the roll surface. So, the particles are gripped between the two counter-rotating rolls and densification occurs due to the reduction in the roll gap as the powder is dragged to the closest point between rolls. This results in a substantial increase in the roll pressure. The high pressure exerted on the powder causes the breakage of brittle particles and the deformation of plastic ones. The new fractured particles, caused by the fragmentation, and the deformed ones lead to more contact points between the particulate. This induces the bonding of particles at the molecular level due to the effect of Van der Waals forces (Parikh, 2005). The maximum pressure exerted by the rolls is reached at the neutral angle, which does not necessarily occur at the smallest roll gap because of wall slip and other factors (Salman et al., 2006).

=== Page 16 - list_item ===
3. The release region: Finally, the compacted ribbon is relieved in the release region, where the roll gap starts to increase again the exerted pressure ceases to exist. After the ejection, because of the absence of constraints and stresses, the compacted ribbon may increase in size due to elastic recovery (Salman et al., 2006). The enlargement concern mainly the ribbon thickness and this occurs mainly when dealing with plastic powder materials.

particles move slower than the roll surface, and so they slip. In the slip region, the powder is pre-densified primarily due to particle rearrangement and de-aeration, as a consequence of the little stresses applied by the feeding system. The main factors affecting the powder behaviour in the feed region are the frictional properties of the particulate materials, such as wall and inter-particle friction.

The extent of the nip region depends on the material characteristics and operating parameters. Common values are: 5° < a < 20°.

1.2.1 Solid Fraction

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
The solid fraction (SF), or relative density, is defined as the ratio between the envelope/bulk density and the true density:

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
y= Pe Pr

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
y= Pe 1.1 Pr (11)

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
It can also be defined using the porosity, ¢, in fact, it results:

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
y=l1-e.

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
y=l1-e. (1.2)

=== Page 16 - main_text ===
Envelope density, also known as bulk density, is determined for porous materials by including the volume occupied by the pore spaces within the material in the measurement. Conversely, true density is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the solid material to the volume occupied by that mass; therefore, the volume contributions of pores or internal voids are removed in the

measurement. The envelope and true density of the powder mixture are usually determined by helium and powder pycnometer.

=== Page 17 - main_text ===
The SF is the most important intermediate roll compaction product attribute which has a great impact on the downstream processes. Besides the equipment and process-related parameters, it has a significant influence on the granule size distribution in the milling step. Additionally, it is correlated to the flowability, stickiness, reworkability, mechanical strength, homogeneity of the content, disintegration, and dissolution of the resulting grains (Amini and Akseli, 2020). In the roll compaction process, the SF is determined by the flowability and compressibility properties of the powder blend, as well as by machine operating settings.

=== Page 17 - main_text ===
The term ‘compressibility’ is defined as the ability of a powder to decrease in volume under pressure, while ‘compactibility’ is defined as the ability of the powdered material to be compressed into a tablet of specified strength (i.e. radial tensile strength or deformation hardness).

=== Page 17 - main_text ===
1.2.2 Advantages and limitations of roll compaction

=== Page 17 - main_text ===
The distinctive advantage of roll compaction, over other granulation techniques, is its possibility of processing physically or chemically moisture-sensitive materials since the use of liquid binders is not required. Another benefit is that it does not require a drying stage and therefore it is suitable for compounds that either have a low melting point or degrade rapidly upon heating (Leuenberger, 1982). In addition, compared to other dry granulation techniques, such as slugging, roll compaction is a continuous process with higher productivity but less energy consumption and can produce more homogeneous products (Miguélez-Moran et al., 2008). Another key aspect of the increasing popularity of the roll compaction process is the possibility of implementation of online and automation process settings leading to an improvement in product quality, minimizing batch-to-batch variability (Salman et al., 2006). Together with all the aforementioned advantages this granulation technology has several disadvantages that are the current subject of research and development. One of the most critical limitations is referred to the “loss of compactability”. When a powder mixture is granulated and milled using roll compaction, the resulting tables do not develop as much tensile strength as tablets produced by direct compression of the initial powder blend. For this reason, the analysis of ribbon and tablet product qualities is usually studied combined (Farber et al., 2008). The high fraction of uncompacted material, referred to as “fines”, during the roll compaction process is another critical drawback. It is mainly caused by two mechanisms: on the one hand

=== Page 17 - main_text ===
The high fraction of uncompacted material, referred to as “fines”, during the roll compaction process is another critical drawback. It is mainly caused by two mechanisms: on the one hand by powder that passes the rolls without being compacted and on the other hand by particles generated during the milling step (Reimer and Kleinebudde, 2019). The produced fines can be re-compacted in order to improve the yield, nevertheless, the recycling of fines can lead to inappropriate drug uniformity, therefore the re-compaction of fines is not an advisable manner

to increase the throughput. The amount of fines can be reduced, when high compaction pressure, sealing system, and vacuum de-aeration are applied, albeit too high compaction pressure can lead to reduced compactibility of granules (Inghelbrecht and Remon, 1998). Moreover, the roll compacted ribbon is characterized by density heterogeneity across the roll width and length. This is related to the friction between the powder and the used sealing system, which leads to density variations across the ribbon width. Additionally, the periodical pattern of the screw feeder is visible along the ribbon length in a sinusoidal curve of more densified material (Perez-Gandarillas, 2016). This variability can propagate along the downstream process and influences the tablet quality. It is also required to include a certain amount of lubricant in the powder mixture to avoid material sticking on the roll surface.

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
The most challenging problem in the roll compaction process is represented in the optimization of processing conditions and the scale-up. This is critical due to the complex behavior of the particulate materials that undergo compaction and also because of the diversity of formulations used in the pharmaceutical industry. This has become even more difficult considering the variety of different equipment designs (Yu, 2013). Suboptimal operation of the equipment can lead to unsatisfactory products.

1.2.3 Process variables

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
The process variable, i.e. machine settings, that can be adjusted, in order to obtain the desired granules, are common among all the most modern roll compactors. They can be set manually by the operators or controlled by means of the RC controlling system. They are listed, together with the acronym that will be used in this Thesis, as follows:

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
e Specific Roll Force (SRF): The specific roll force represents the force that the roll provides to the powder to be compacted between them. It is expressed in kN per cm of roll width. Among all the machine parameters, it is influencing the ribbon and granules’ properties the most.

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
e Roll Gap (S): The roll gap represents the minimum value of the distance between the two counter-rotating rolls. It is usually expressed in mm.

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
e Roll Speed (RS): The counter-rotating rolls move simultaneously with the same speed. Their speed is usually expressed in rounds per minute (rpm). In the case of comparison of roll compactors with different roll diameters, the velocity is expressed as the circumferential one in m/s.

=== Page 18 - main_text ===
e Screw Speed: Some roller compactor uses a screw feeding system to deliver the powder blend to the slip region. By adjusting the feeding screw speed, the amount of conveyed powder can be regulated.

1.2.4 Roller compactor design

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
Even though the process variables are common among all industrial RC, the specific designs of the instrumentation present a large degree of variability. These different designs have the capability to affect the properties of the produced ribbons as explained below.

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
1.2.4.1 Feeding mechanism

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
The feeding system is a key element of the roller compactor because it has to provide a uniform and continuous flow of powders in order to fill the region between the rolls. If this is not achieved correctly the formed ribbon will present heterogeneity. The powder to be compacted can be fed to the slip region by gravity or by force-feeding using a screw feeder.

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
In a gravity feed roller compactor, a hopper contains the powder blend and it guides its delivery to the region between rolls. The hopper is usually equipped with an agitator to break powder bridges. Similarly, in the force-feeding system, a screw is placed inside a hopper and the screw is directed to the space between the rolls.

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
The choice between one feeding system or another is mainly driven according to the flow properties, the density of the powder, and the densification required. Gravity feed is suitable in the case of powder with good flowability, even though it presents some drawbacks due to feeding fluctuations and air escaping. Force feed fits better in the case of poor-flowing particles (Salman et al., 2006).

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
1.2.4.2 Rolls layout

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
The rotating rolls can be mounted in three different positions: horizontal, inclined, and vertical. These different layouts are shown in Figure 1.5.

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
Figure 1.5. Configuration of roll compactors (A) horizontal (B) inclined (C) vertical (Guigon and Simon, 2003).

=== Page 19 - main_text ===
The firstly invented and most commonly used is the horizontal layout with the vertical feeding system. This arrangement can cause by-pass and leakage problems in the case of powder with excellent flowability properties. This issue can be solved using the combination of horizontal feeding and vertical roll layouts, in which the production of uncompacted material is reduced.

However, due to the influence of gravity on the transport of the particles, the densification may result asymmetrical. Hence, the inclined design has been developed in order to possess both advantages of the aforementioned designs (Teng et al., 2009)

=== Page 20 - main_text ===
1.2.4.3 Roll surface

=== Page 20 - main_text ===
There are several roll surface options, including smooth, knurled, serrated, and grooved surfaces, as shown in Figure 1.6. The different degrees of roughness of the roll wall impact the friction between the powder particles and the roll surfaces. This can be particularly useful when the loose powder has to be compacted (Szappanos-Csordas, 2018).

=== Page 20 - main_text ===
1.2.4.4 Sealing system

=== Page 20 - main_text ===
An important issue to be prevented is the sideway migration of the powder outside the compaction area. For this reason, RC present either a side-sealing system or a rim-roll sealing system, as shown in Figure 1.7.

=== Page 20 - main_text ===
(a) (b)

=== Page 21 - main_text ===
The side-sealing system consists of two plates that form a physical barrier beside the gap width. To avoid metal-metal contact and wear, the side plate is often composed of a PTFE platelet (Salman et al., 2006). The rim-roll sealing system is characterized by one single roll having edges on both sides, while the other roll fits and moves inside the cavity created by these rims. The sealing mechanism utilized has an effect on the manufactured ribbon; for example, the rim- roll sealing system produces a more homogeneous density distribution than the side-sealing system. This is due to uniform pressure distribution along the ribbon width and a reduction in uncompacted material.

1.3 Compactor simulator

=== Page 21 - main_text ===
The interest in simulating roll compaction processes is particularly high, especially during the early phase of new formulation development. This is primarily due to the limited availability and high cost associated with new APIs. The roll compaction process itself is both time- consuming and material intensive. However, with the aid of an accurate physical simulation, quickly identifying the appropriate process parameters in order to achieve the optimal ribbon quality attributes becomes possible. Consequently, simulations have the potential to significantly expedite the development process and result in substantial cost reductions. Reproducing the behavior of the powder undergoing compaction by the rolls is challenging due to the complex events that take place. A technique for mimicking the roll compaction process has been developed by Zinchuk et al. (2004) utilizing a laboratory uniaxial press where the punches move with a sinusoidal profile. By utilizing this sine function, the top and bottom punches are capable of emulating the rotational movement of a given point on the roll surface. The mathematical formulation of the simulation is:

=== Page 21 - main_text ===
D=Rsin(ot),

=== Page 21 - main_text ===
where D is the punches displacement, R is the roll radius, w is the roll rotation frequency and t¢ is time (Zinchuk et al., 2004). The schematic representation of the simulation transfer is shown in Figure 1.9.

=== Page 21 - main_text ===
Initially, the powder mixture is inserted in the die chamber of the compactor simulator. At t= 0, the punches start to travel towards each other, compressing the powder at the same strain as in the real roll compaction process. The apex of the sinusoidal profile corresponds to the point at which punches and points on the roll surface achieve their minimum spacing and can be used to target the thickness of the simulated ribbons. When the punches have reached their minimum separation, they retract to decompress the ribbon before it is ejected to the die surface by the bottom punch.

The compacted product of the compactor simulator is called ribblet, and its appearance, compared with the ribbon one, is shown in Figure 1.10. The shape of the ribblets is determined by the tooling size and geometry, which can be round or rectangular.

To quantitatively evaluate the simulation, two key indicators of the ribblets and ribbons quality have been used and compared by Zinchuk et al., (2004): the SF and the tensile strength. The powder material in the analysis was microcrystalline cellulose. The results showed that ribbons and ribblets with similar SFs exhibit good agreement in tensile strength comparison, indicating that the method is valid for evaluating roll compaction behaviour.

This method, therefore, has the great advantage of allowing rapid characterization of the pharmaceutical powders with minimum consumption of material, i.e., in the order of hundreds of milligrams. However, this methodology uses a batch process, i.e., the direct punches

compaction, to model a continuous process, i.e., roll compaction. As a result, the simulation is not unable to account for some roll compaction variables associated with continuous operation, such as the feeding system's inhomogeneous powder transport and shear forces on the roll surface (Zinchuk et al., 2004).

Roll compaction modelling

=== Page 25 - main_text ===
The Johanson model, which is used in this Thesis to characterise the behaviour of pharmaceutical powders during the roll compaction process, is introduced in this chapter. The physical and mathematical theory of the model and its capability to predict the pressure exerted by the rolls are explained. After that, the theory of the mass correction factor is introduced, which is designed to account for differences between estimated roll pressures and measured simulator ones. This constitutes the base of the proposed methodology for accelerating development operations.

=== Page 25 - main_text ===
2.1 Johanson (1965) model

=== Page 25 - main_text ===
Over the years, numerous theoretical models have been developed to explore the mechanics of roll compaction and predict the quality of the resulting compacts. In 1965, Johanson introduced a rolling theory for granular solids. It was the first mathematical model for predicting the extent of the compression region and the pressure distribution after the powder are gripped by the rolls. Following this, Katashinkii (1986) utilized the slab method to analyse the nip region, enabling the prediction of pressure distribution and roll separating force, based on an analysis of metal rolling operations (Reynolds et al., 2010). Both the Johanson model and the slab model are one-dimensional models. In pursuit of more comprehensive insights, researchers have proposed two- and three-dimensional models for roll compaction, focusing on finite element methods (FEM) and discrete element methods (DEM). These numerical approaches offer the advantage of providing detailed and realistic representations of the roll compaction process by considering various material properties, geometries, and particle-particle interactions. However, both FEM and DEM come with inherent limitations, including computational complexity, challenges in calibration, numerical issues, and the requirement for accurate material properties to implement the simulations (Salman et al., 2006).

=== Page 25 - main_text ===
The Johanson model's ongoing popularity in roll compaction modelling can be ascribed to a number of factors. Firstly, it provides valuable insights into the compaction process, considering density packing and stress relaxation mechanisms, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. Secondly, the model delivers reasonably accurate predictions of critical process parameters, further enhancing its appeal for practical

applications. Furthermore, the Johanson model has demonstrated strong agreement with experimental data across a wide range of pharmaceutical materials and settings. Because of its broad use, it has become an extremely useful tool for process control and scale-up research. Additionally, its relatively straightforward implementation makes it accessible to researchers and engineers without extensive computational expertise, setting it apart from more complex numerical methods like FEM or DEM.

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
The Johanson model provides predictions of the roll normal stress distribution, roll torque and force, nip angle, i.e., the angular location along the roll surface at which powder begins to move at the velocity of the rolls and ribbon density at the roll gap. Its predictive capability reduces costs and time, minimizing experimental trials, thus, enabling one to focus on promising process conditions. It aids in the design of robust procedures and high-quality pharmaceutical products by improving understanding of roll compaction mechanics. Furthermore, the model predicts ribbon density and porosity, allowing for better process control and uniformity during production.

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
In his paper, Johanson divided the zone between the rolls into two regions, as shown in Figure 1.4:

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
i) the slip region, where the slip occurs along the roll surface

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
ii) the nip region, where a no-slip boundary condition applies.

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
The transition from slip to nonslip region defines the nip angle a. The zone beyond the minimum roll gap is usually defined as the release region in which the stresses are relieved and the compacts were extruded from the system.

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
2.1.1 Pressure distribution in the slip region

=== Page 26 - main_text ===
To describe the powder behaviour in the slip region, Johanson developed its model on the basis of the Jenike and Shield (1959) criterion for steady-state particle flow in silo and hopper. The roll compacted material is assumed to be isotropic, frictional, cohesive and compressible and also to obey the effective yield function proposed by Jenike and Shield (1959) (Salman et al., 2006). The latter was used by Johanson to represent the plane-strain and plane stress condition of the granular solid between the rolls. The effective yield function for plane strain and plane stress condition of the powder material between the rolls can be represented in Figure 2.1, where Og is the effective angle of friction, Py is the angle of wall friction and v is the acute angle between the tangent to the roll surface and the direction of the major principal stress 0, (Mansa, 2006). The effective angle of friction d,and the angle of wall friction @y are material properties that can be experimentally measured by means of a ring shear test.

The circle represents the Mohr’s circle, which is a method for representing the steady state stress in a material as function of that material. Every point on the circle represents a combination of normal stress o and shear stress T on some plane. The two planes of most interest are the planes on which the shear stress is zero, which are known as the major principal plane and the minor principal plane. The stresses acting on these planes are known as the major principal stress o, and the minor principal stress 63. By means of these two stresses the effective yield equation can be written as (Mansa, 2006):

=== Page 27 - main_text ===
O1- 93 sin dg = a + 03 (2.1)

=== Page 27 - main_text ===
At the roll surface, the relationship between the tangential and the normal forces is given by the wall yield locus, as reported in Figure 2.1, where the shear stress and the normal stress at the surface of the rollers are described by Point A. The angle of wall friction @y describes this locus but, for calculation purposes, it is more convenient to use the acute angle v (Mansa, 2006):

As a result, if the nip angle is known, the pressure distribution between the rolls may be calculated. Eq. (2.10) is only applicable for angles 8 < a@.When slip does not occur along the roll surface, pressure o is given by (2.9) and the pressure gradient is (Johanson, 1965):

2.1.3 Determination of the nip angle

=== Page 30 - main_text ===
Johanson (1965) proposed that the nip angle can be determined by finding the angle at which the pressure gradients for the slip and no-slip conditions were equal. Hence, the nip angle can be determined by equating (2.3) and (2.11) and solving for 8 = a:

=== Page 30 - main_text ===

=== Page 30 - main_text ===
The nonlinear equation (2.12) must be solved numerically. The intersection of the two vertical pressure gradients, which coincide with the angular position equal to a, is shown in Figure 2.4.

=== Page 30 - main_text ===

Pressure gradient (da/dx)

=== Page 30 - main_text ===
The solid line in the Figure 2.4 represents a typical pressure gradient profile given by (2.3) for the condition of slip along the roll surface. When 8 = @;, which represents the upper boundary of the slip region, as shown in Figure 1.4, the pressure gradient do /dx is zero. On the other hand, when slip does not occur along the roll surface, the pressure gradient is provided by (2.11), which is depicted in Figure 2.4 as a dashed line.

=== Page 30 - main_text ===
Considering how (2.12) is expressed, it results that the nip angle value depends on the compressibility constant K, on the material flowability properties, dg and @y, and on the roller compactor machine settings D and S. However, the impact of the geometry parameters on the value of @ is almost negligible, provided that S/D " 1. The effect of material properties on the value of the nip angle is shown by means of surface plots in Figure 2.5.

=== Page 30 - main_text ===
It can be seen that dg has a lower effect, while @y and K have a strong impact on the determination of the value of a. Greater dy and K, wider will be the nip region and so the angle from which the powder mixture will start to be compacted by the rolls.

2.1.4 Peak pressure and ribbon solid fraction

=== Page 31 - main_text ===
Once the nip angle has been determined, the pressure distribution between the rolls can be calculated from (2.10). The resulting SF of the ribbon obtained from the roll compaction process is determined by the maximum pressure applied to the powder material during compression. In practical applications, the peak pressure, denoted as Pyg,, corresponds to the maximum pressure exerted on the powder at the minimum roll gap S when 6 = 0, and it can be related to the roller force, represented as Ry [KN], according to the Johanson model:

=== Page 31 - main_text ===
2Rr Fmax = W7pF , (2.13)

=== Page 31 - main_text ===
where F is the force factor and it is defined as:

=== Page 31 - main_text ===
K 0=a(Sz.pw.K) (3) F= I cos@ dé. (2.14) 0 =0 (1 +3-cos 6) cos

=== Page 31 - main_text ===
This represents a relationship between process parameters (roll force Ry, roll separation distance S), geometric parameters (roll diameter D, roll width W) and material properties (effective angle of internal friction 6;, angle of wall friction @y and compressibility K (Reynolds et al., 2010). Eq. (2.14) implicitly assumes the contributions of the pressure on the rolls in the slip region and the release region are negligible. According to (2.14) the peak pressure increases as the specific roll force increase while it decreases as the roll gap increases. The trend of the peak pressure as function of the two adjustable machine setting parameters is shown in Figure 2.6, where data are generated using (2.13) and (2.14):

Bindhumadhavan et al. (2005) used an instrumented roll compactor fitted with a miniature piezoelectric transducer in order to measure the pressure profile normal to the roll surface. They found that the pressure distribution is reasonably predicted from Eq. (2.10), although the measured pressure increased more strongly than the predicted as the material enters the nip region. They also found that the peak pressure applied was very accurately predicted (Bindhumadhavan et al., 2005).

=== Page 32 - main_text ===
Once the peak pressure is known it can be used to determine the relative density that results from the applied pressure of the rolls. Eq. (2.10) is based on a power law relationship between material density and pressure. Following this, the relative density or SF of the ribbon yp, can be estimated from the peak pressure as follows:

=== Page 32 - main_text ===
1

=== Page 32 - main_text ===
YR >= YoPnax , (2.15)

=== Page 32 - main_text ===
where 7p is referred to as the pre-consolidation relative density or pre-consolidation solid fraction, which is, similarly to K, a compaction parameter depending on the material. yy and K represent the two model parameters of the Johanson model, whose values have to be calibrated using experimental data from roller compactor experiments. Typically, the pre-consolidation density Yy corresponds to the relative density at a reference pressure of 1 MPa (Moroney et al., 2020).

=== Page 32 - main_text ===
After determining the values of yg and K, it becomes possible to construct the compression profile that describes the trend of the ribbon SF and the predicted peak pressure, according to (2.15). An illustrative example of the roller compactor compression profile is depicted in Figure 2.7.

2.1.5 Assumptions and limits of the Johanson model

=== Page 33 - main_text ===
As described in the previous section, the Johanson model comes with certain limitations due to its underlying assumptions. Firstly, the material is assumed to be isotropic, frictional, cohesive, compressible and to obey the effective yield function proposed by Jenike and Shield (1959). When deriving (2.6), it is assumed that: i) the plane strain of the element of volume Vg remains perfectly plane, ii) mass continuity theory holds true, or iii) there is no velocity gradient through the ribbon thickness as the element of material moves to minimum gap between the rolls (Bi et al., 2014). Additional powder properties used in the model include the effective angle of internal friction and the powder-roll friction angle, both of which are assumed constant with relative density, which is reasonable at the large stresses expected in a RC (Liu and Wassgren, 2016). Moreover, the Johanson model assumes negligible elastic recovery of the ribbon formed during the compaction process, thus simplifying the material behaviour by considering minimal or no rebound of the particles after compression. This assumption can lead to a discrepancy between the predicted SF at the minimum roll gap and the measured one due to the increase in ribbon

volume resulting from elastic recovery. Additionally, the model assumes the roll gap to be fully filled with powder, neglecting the possibility of air entrapment. In practice, air entrapment can occur, significantly affecting the overall densification process and leading to ribbon density and porosity variations.

=== Page 34 - main_text ===
2.2 Mass correction factor theory

=== Page 34 - main_text ===
Despite the fact that the Johanson model is widely and consistently used to characterise roll compaction, various investigations have demonstrated that it tends to result in disparities between predicted and actual pressure values (Reynolds et al., 2010; Bi et al., 2014; Toson et al., 2019; So et al., 2021). In the attempt to validate the Johanson model, especially regarding the estimation of peak pressure applied by the rollers, predicted pressure values were compared with measurements obtained from uniaxial compaction equipment. Such comparisons, however, regularly resulted in disagreements, mainly because of the inaccurate assumption of one-dimensional flow of the powder particles within the nip region. According to Bi et al. (2014), this assumption is erroneous because the material close to the roll surface moves quicker than the material further away from the roll surface in the nip region. The velocity gradient gradually decreases as the powder particles move from the nip angle toward the minimum gap, as illustrated in Figure 2.8, where particles velocities between the rollers are represented by a contour plot from a FEM simulation.

=== Page 34 - main_text ===
The Johanson model assumes that the entire element of powder material moves at the same speed as the roll. Consequently, Johanson's rolling theory overestimates the amount of material delivered to the minimum roll gap, leading to an overprediction of the maximum roll pressure.

In their study, Bi et al. (2014) introduced a mass correction factor fg into the mass conservation equation in the nip region (2.6). This correction factor was incorporated to address the variation in mass within each element caused by multi-dimensional flow:

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
Vep's = foVaPa-

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
The variable that has been corrected using the mass correction factor is represented by the symbol with the apex. The introduction of the mass correction factor in (2.17) changes not only the stress-density connection but also the stress-volume relationship (Bi et al., 2014):

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
Ga _ (A ope) - (“2): (2.18) o"4 P'6 foVal

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
Combining now (2.18) with (2.10), the resulting pressure in the no-slip region is:

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
K fo (1 +3 - cos a) cos a 0'9 = 0g (2.19) (1 ty - cos) cos 8

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
Following the same derivation line, the force factor becomes:

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
K 9=a(6¢.w-K) fo (3) F= I F cos6 dé, (2.20) 9=0 (1 +5 -cos8) cos 8

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
where fo is the actual fraction of powder delivered from nip angle a to angle 8 = 0, so that the force factor from (2.21) can be written as (Bi et al., 2014):

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
K 0=a(Sz.dw.K) (5) F= | -_ cosé6 dé. (2.21) 6=0 (1+ 7 -cos@) cos @

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
Moving fo outside the integral from (2.20) to (2.21), it implicitly assumes that the mass correction factor is 9-independent. This assumption has been shown to be incorrect by Liu et al. (2016), who performed a roll compaction FEM simulation in which they demonstrate the dependence of the mass correction factor on position @ within the roll compactor. Nevertheless, despite the lack of mathematical rigor, the equation proposed by Bi et al. (2014), where the correction was presented as a multiplier outside the integral, demonstrated acceptable predictive capabilities without necessitating additional simulation efforts, thus enhancing its practical applicability (So et al., 2021).

=== Page 35 - main_text ===
From (2.21) the peak pressure exerted by the rolls at 9 = 0 can be rewritten as:

=== Page 35 - main_text ===

Rearranging (2.22) maximum roll surface pressure after mass correction Pg, is derived as follow (Bi et al., 2014):

The pressures predicted by the Johanson model P,,q, model and the pressures experimentally measured by a uniaxial compactor P'mg, for the same SF obtained in the compacted product can now be related through (2.23). This correction, in fact, accounts for the overprediction of the exerted roll pressure for the same values of SF. In this Thesis, (2.23) is revised to explicitly state the CS pressure as:

=== Page 36 - main_text ===
Pes = fo Pmax -

=== Page 36 - main_text ===
To account for pressure overprediction fo has to assumed values lower than 1. In their case study, Bi et al. (2014) employed the mass correction factor theory, investigating three different active pharmaceutical powder mixtures on both the roller compactor and the uniaxial compactor. The mass correction factor fg was used to explain the differences in pressure for the experimental obtained data. The absolute values of fo linking the different pressures of each roller compactor experimental data ranged between 0.86 and 0.89. This indicated that only 86% to 89% of the powder material, as claimed by the Johanson model, was delivered at the angle 6 = 0. Additionally, their research revealed that the mean values of the factor fo derived for the three powder mixtures were similar.

=== Page 36 - main_text ===
This Thesis aims to analyse the pressure differences between experimental results obtained from the RC and the CS. The bridging element that will allow a relationship between the two pressures to be created is the mass correction factor. Initially, an exploratory analysis will be made to examine the values of fo required to link the different pressures for each analysed powder mixture, as done in previous literature work. Based on this analysis, a methodology, based on the mass correction factor, for predicting roller compactor pressures based purely on simulator data will be proposed.

3.1 Powder mixture

=== Page 37 - main_text ===
In this Thesis, seven different pharmaceutical powder mixtures were considered. Four of them were placebo formulations, i.e., they did not contain any APIs. They were designed to resemble a real drug in appearance, but had no therapeutic effects on the body. The use of placebo formulations has relevance in clinical studies since it allows for the assessment of the effectiveness of new drugs. The remaining three powder combinations, on the other hand, contained APIs amounts. However, while the precise weight compositions were known, the specific mixture components themselves were not.

=== Page 37 - main_text ===
Placebo formulations were made of different excipients, which are inert or inactive powder materials added to ease the tabletting operation and to improve the quality of the tablet. However, the term excipient includes multiple kinds of particle components with distinct functions: diluent, binders, lubricants, disintegrants, and glidants. The four placebo formulations in the analysis contained four different commonly used excipients:

=== Page 37 - main_text ===
Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC): Microcrystalline cellulose is a purified, partially depolymerised cellulose that occurs as a white, odourless, tasteless, crystalline powder composed of porous particles. MCC is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry as an ideal binder, due to its excellent compactability under a wide range of compaction pressures, and its resistance to organic and non-organic contaminants (Yu, 2013). Microcrystalline cellulose, like the following excipients, is commercially available with different grades according to its method of manufacture, particle size, moisture content, flow, and other

physical properties (Rowe et al., 2009). MCC Avicel® PH 102 was the specific grade used in this Thesis, and it is characterized by a nominal mean particle size of 100 um. Because of its deformation behaviour under compaction pressure, microcrystalline cellulose is considered a plastic material.

=== Page 38 - main_text ===
Anhydrous lactose: Anhydrous lactose is a disaccharide sugar, that occurs as white to off- white crystalline particles or powder. It is widely used in tablet manufacturing for its filler and binder properties and also because of its low moisture content. Lactose anhydrous Supertab® AN 21 was the specific grade of this excipient used in this Thesis. It presents a nominal mean particle size equal to ~ 150 um (Rowe et al., 2009). Differently from MCC, lactose is considered a brittle material because of its fragile deformation.

=== Page 38 - main_text ===
Mannitol: Mannitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that occurs as a white, odourless, crystalline powder. It is mostly utilised in the pharmaceutical industry as a diluent for tablet drugs, where it is particularly advantageous because it is not hygroscopic and therefore may be used with moisture-sensitive APIs. In this work, Mannitol Pearlitol® 200SD was used. Being a spray-dried grade of mannitol, it presents a larger surface and better compactability compared to unprocessed mannitol. Similarly to lactose, the mean particle size of mannitol 200 SD is equal to ~ 170 um (Perez-Gandarillas, 2016). Similarly to anhydrous lactose, spry-dried mannitol possesses a brittle behaviour.

=== Page 38 - main_text ===
Magnesium stearate (MgSt): Magnesium stearate is primarily used in tablet manufacture as a lubricant. Its concentration in the formulation is kept usually between 0.25% and 5.0% (Rowe et al., 2009).

All the seven pharmaceutical blends that were used in this Thesis are reported, with their composition, in Table 3.1. The term “formulation” is used to refer to the placebo powder mixture, while the term “compound” refers to powder blends containing APIs.

=== Page 39 - main_text ===
The excipients in the first three formulations were the same; however, their weight percentages differed. Formulation 4, on the other hand, was the only placebo formulation that contained Mannitol. Compound C stood out among the active mixes when compared to the others, mainly because of the amount of API it contained. To distinguish the different APIs contained in the three Compound powder blends, a numerical subscript is used in Table 3.1 (APIi, APIz, APIs). The composition and pharmaceutical grade of excipients in the active compounds may differ from those contained in the four placebo formulations.

For the specific scopes of this Thesis, the powder blends were characterized for material properties like true density, the effective angle of internal friction, and the wall friction angle. This information was strictly required in order to solve the Johanson model, as in (2.16), and to calculate the SF, eq. (1.1), of the compacted products.

In the present Thesis, the experimental results regarding the roll compaction were performed using the Gerties Mini-Pactor® (Gerteis Machinen + Processengineering AG, Jona, Switzerland). Due to its dimension and the powder quantity that it can work, Mini-Pactor is a RC used for mainly for laboratory development and pilot projects. The theoretical maximum throughput declared by the company is 100 kg/h, however, the maximum throughput that can be achieved during operation is typically in the range of 50-70 kg/h (Bano et al., 2022).

The Gerteis Mini-Pactor® was equipped with a horizontally positioned feeding screw and an inclined tamping screw. The rim-roll sealing system, as illustrated in Section §1.2.4.4, has been adopted for the experimental campaigns. As for the specific choice of roll surface, the knurled type was selected. These specific layouts are shown in Figure 3.3.

=== Page 40 - main_text ===
The rolls presented a diameter equal to 250 mm and a width of 25 mm; and they were set up with the inclined layout, specifically with an angle of 30° corresponding to the horizontal plane.

Multiple runs were carried out at various combinations of machine settings in order to investigate the behaviour of the compacted powder at various pressures exerted. The roll speed was kept constant at 2 rpm, while the specific roll force and the roll gap were adjusted depending on the run. Typically, for conducting an experimental campaign involving four different conditions, i.e., four runs, at least of 2.5 kg of material is required. The summary of all roller compactor experimental campaigns is reported in Table 3.3.

Formulations 2,3 and 4 were tested with the same total number of runs and with the same machine setting combinations. Formulation 1, on the other hand, had a slightly different testing process, as it was evaluated using only the first five machine setting combinations of the other formulations. Moreover, Compounds A, B and C were investigated using completely different experimental protocols, in terms of machine parameter pairings that were adjusted during their experimental campaign. A total of 27 runs were done for Compound A, adjusting 8 distinct combinations of machine settings, with at least two runs performed for each. As a result, six ribbon samples were available for each combination of machine settings. Regarding Compound B, four combinations of machine parameters were used, but, in only one of them, multiple

repetitions were performed. Finally, 23 runs were carried out for compound C, with up to 10 distinct combinations of machine parameters being adjusted. It should be noted that these combinations showed specific roller force values that were close to one another. The addition of multiple repetitions within a single run also provides the opportunity to investigate and analyse the process variability.

3.2.2 Ribbon solid fraction

=== Page 43 - main_text ===
Three samples were obtained from the compacted ribbon for each run to determine the envelope density and hence the SF of the ribbon. Rectangular samples with dimensions of 25 by 10 mm were extracted from the ribbon for the envelope density measurement. The three independent samples were taken at different segments of the ribbon to account for the potential variability of SF over the width and length of the ribbon. The envelope density of each sample was measured using a powder pycnometer (GeoPyc® 1365, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) to calculate the SF of the ribbon, as indicated in (1.1). Because the sample were extracted from the ribbon after compaction, this measurement is referred to as "out-of-die." This term is used to distinguish between SF samples obtained at the precise moment of maximum compaction and those obtained after compaction. Because of the influence of elastic recovery in out-of-die samples, distinguishing between the two measurements is critical. When pressure is released, the compacted material expands, resulting in an increase in volume and, as a result, a decrease in bulk density and SF. To ensure reliable comparisons, it is important to consistently specify whether measurements are performed in-die or out-of-die.

=== Page 43 - main_text ===
By having three samples available for each run, it becomes possible to calculate the corresponding standard deviation, which enables the analysis of intra-run variability. The RC dataset for Compound C only contains the average values corresponding to each run. All the measured values of the ribbon SF for each RC dataset are reported in the Tables in Section §A.1 of the Appendix.

3.3 Compactor simulator

=== Page 43 - main_text ===
During this project, the compaction behaviour of powder mixtures was studied by running more than a single experimental campaign for each of them on the CS. As will be elucidated in this section, the experimental campaigns also differed in the diameters of the punches used for the simulator. Furthermore, Compound C was investigated using a distinct CS, which employed a different modality for moving the punches compared to the method utilized for other powder mixtures. For this reason, the results concerning this specific powder blend will be treated separately from those tested on the same piece of equipment. The two different CS are shown in Figure 3.4.

The initial CS datasets came from an experimental campaign carried out by a third-party company (Merlin Powder Characterisation, Brierley Hill, UK). The reason behind this was an initial mechanical issue with the GSK® simulator, which required the use of equipment from a third-party company. The equipment used was the Phoenix® (Phoenix Calibration & Services Ltd, Bobbington, UK) compactor simulator equipped with round punches with tooling diameters equal to 18 mm. In each test, an automated process filled the CS die with a specific amount of the powder mixture. The pressure was applied through a sinusoidal profile using two counter-moving punches, as illustrated in Section §1.3. In this experimental campaign, only Formulations 2,3 and 4 were tested. The summary of the 18mm Phoenix® CS experimental campaign is reported in Table 3.4.

Formulation 2 was tested at only two treatment levels, where five repetitions were performed for each. Formulations 3 and 4, instead, were investigated at three treatment levels, where ten repetitions were performed at the edge levels and 5 at the central level.

A second experimental using the Phoenix® CS was performed internally in GSK®. Through this experimental campaign, all powder mixtures, except Compound C, were tested using round punches with a diameter of 10 mm. Because of the smaller diameter diameters, this configuration has an additional advantage in that it requires fewer materials during the experimental phase. Approximately 250 mg of powder mixture is required for a single test using this setup. The summary of the 10mm Styl'One® CS experimental campaign is reported in Table 3.5.

For each powder blend, the total number of experiments were performed among various treatment levels. Within each treatment level, five experiments were carried out. The number of experiments and pressure ranges evaluated for all formulations is substantially larger than in the 18 mm CS datasets, enabling the best description of the behaviour of the powder being compressed. Given that an experimental campaign on CS normally includes 35 tests, each of which consumes roughly 250 mg of material, the total material consumption on a simulator with a punch diameter of 10 mm is approximately 9 grams. In comparison, as pointed out in the previous section, an experimental campaign on RC requires a minimum of 8 runs, with an average of 2.5 kg of material utilized per 4 runs. Consequently, a complete experimental campaign on the RC necessitates at least about 5 kg of material. This implies that the material used for a full experimental campaign on the RC is approximately 550 times greater than what is needed to complete an experimental campaign on the CS.

=== Page 45 - main_text ===
Compound A and B were again tested using the Phoenix® CS but with a further size of tooling diameter, i.e., 21.85 mm. With this setup, more material, compared to the 10 mm punches diameter layout, is required for a single test; in fact, 700 mg of powder is required. These datasets are summarized in Table 3.6.

=== Page 45 - main_text ===
The pressure range explored in the 21.85mm simulator datasets is substantially narrower than the pressure range investigated in the 10 and 18 mm datasets, resulting in much smaller intervals of the produced SF. Consequently, these datasets, as they are, do not provide an adequate understanding of the compressibility behaviour of a specific powder.

=== Page 46 - main_text ===
Lastly, Compound C was investigated using a Styl'One® (Medelpharm, France) compactor simulator, equipped with 11.29 mm tooling diameters. In contrast to previous campaigns on the Phoenix® CS, where pressure was applied with a sinusoidal profile utilising two counter- moving punches, in this instance a single axial arrangement was used. This indicated that one punch was moving and compacting the powder mixtures while the other remained still. Due to its experimental campaign with a distinct piece of equipment and a different modality, Compound C was treated separately from all the other results obtained from the Phoenix® simulator. The Summary of the 11.29 mm Styl'One® CS experimental campaign is reported in Table 3.7.

3.3.3 Ribblet solid fraction

=== Page 47 - main_text ===
Once the powder blends were compacted by the CS, the samples were ejected from the die by the lower punch. The envelope density of the produced ribblets was measured using the GeoPyc® 1365 powder pycnometer. Similarly to the density measurement in the RC, this measurement was also conducted out-of-die. Consequently, the impact of elastic recovery, which was consistent across both equipment, can be disregarded. All the measured values of the ribblets SF for each CS dataset are reported in the Tables in Section §A.2 of the Appendix.

3.4 Johanson model parameters estimation

=== Page 47 - main_text ===
The estimation of the pressure exerted by the rolls required the values of the two Johanson model parameter, Yo, and Kec, as reported in (2.13) and (2.14). Yo, and Kp are material- dependent parameters, so they are different for each powder mixture. The introduction of subscripts associated with the yg and K allows for distinction based on the equipment from which these parameters have been estimated. Estimation of these parameters required utilizing experimental data on the SF of the ribbon. By employing these results, along with the corresponding machine settings used to obtain them, the model parameters were adjusted to better align with the experimental outcomes. A challenging aspect of estimating the Johanson model parameters was that it did not involve simply fitting a curve or model to given experimental points in the SF-pressure coordinates. In fact, being involved also in the computation of the nip angle and of the peak pressure, the x-coordinates of the experimental points on the SF-pressure diagram changed as Kp- changed. A customized parameter estimation algorithm was necessary to estimate the Johanson model parameters. The iterative computational procedure depicted in Figure 3.6 was employed for this purpose. The input data that the computational procedure required were the following:

3.4.1 Maximum likelihood objective function

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
The objective function chosen to perform the estimation of the Johanson model parameters was the maximum likelihood objective function. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method used to determine the values of model parameters, in such a way that they maximise the likelihood that the data-generating process, described by the model, produced the experiments that were actually observed (Ruud, 2000).

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
The formulation of the maximum likelihood objective function relies on the concept of likelihood. Consider a set of independent and identically distributed random variables {Z1,Z2,...,Zn}, where each Z; follows a proability distribution characterized by the parameter vector 0 = 0,,63,...,0,. The likelihood function is defined as the joint probability of observing the data points 21, Z2, ...,Z, given the parameters values 0.

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
Mathematically, the likelihood function can be expressed as the product of the individual probabilities (Ruud, 2000):

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
n LOL, 225 Zn) = PP Zr Z2y-2q10) = | [Pr (Zi = 2. G1 i=1

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
Independence between datapoint is assumed, which allow to express of the joint probability as the product of individual probabilities. For continuous distributions, the likelihood function corresponds to the probability density function associated to the joint distribution of independent and identically distributed variables Z1,Z2,...,Z, evaluated at the poiny {Z1, Z2, ",Zn} (Ruud, 2000):

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
LOB 2,22, -12n) =| | fe il), G2) t=1

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
where f; (z;|@) denotes the probability density function of the single Z.

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
The values of the parameters that maximize £(0|Z, Z2, ...,Zn) are the maximum likelihood estimates, denoted by 6, which are therefore obtained by the maximization of (Ruud, 2000):

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
6 = arg max L(O|24, 22)" Zn) (3.3)

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
where the arg max function returns the points of the domain of the given function, at which the function values are maximized. The obtained set of the parameters value are the ones that make the observed data most probable.

=== Page 50 - main_text ===
Allowing to deal with summation instead that with the product, the log-likelihood function, £(0|2Z,, 22, ...,Z,), which is the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, is used in the optimization process. This is possible because, since the logarithm function is a continuous

3.4.2 Confidence intervals

=== Page 52 - main_text ===
A crucial component of statistical inference is confidence interval estimation, as it provides a measure of uncertainty in parameter estimates. In fact, confidence intervals provide a range of possible values within which the true parameter value can be expected to lie with a certain level of confidence.

=== Page 52 - main_text ===
Once the values of the Johanson model parameter were estimated as the iterative computational procedure comes to an end, their associated confidence interval must be computed. For this scope the Hessian matrix was used. This matrix was given as an output of the fminunc Matlab® solver once the function reaches an end. The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of the objective function, f :

The Hessian matrix provides important information about the behaviour of a function at a given point, and the Hessian matrix computed at the last iteration, that corresponded to the found minimum, was used to compute the standard errors. The inverse of this matrix, in fact, provides an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix, which contains the variance of the estimated parameters on the diagonal and their covariances off-diagonal (Greene, 2012). Taking the square root of the variances, the standard error SE of the parameters estimates was obtained:

=== Page 53 - main_text ===
SE = ,f/diag (H-) .

Once the standard errors were obtained, confidence intervals can be constructed using a chosen significance level, a. For all this Thesis, the significance level of 95% was chosen, being this value commonly chosen as a default value in most statistical analyses. Once the significance level is selected, the critical value, ty "-2, was derived considering also the assumption of the specific distribution of the parameters. Not having large sample sizes from the RC experimental datasets, a ¢-student distribution whit n-2 degree of freedom was adopted, where n is the number of observations and 2 represent the number of estimated parameters:

3.5 Compactor simulator compression profile parameters

=== Page 53 - main_text ===
The relationship used to describe the behaviour of the ribblets SF as function of the exerted pressure was a power law function (2.15), like the approach suggested by Johanson (1964) to describe the compacted ribbons in the roller compactor. In this equation, two material- dependent parameters, ¥p..,Kcs, are present. To determine their values, calibration was necessary for each powder mixture based on experimental data obtained from the CS The CS compression profile parameters were estimated using a method similar to that used for the Johanson model parameter. However, because the applied pressure was readily available, the calculating technique is simplified in this instance. As a result, parameter estimation required a simple fitting operation on a SF-pressure diagram. Figure 3.7 depicts the iterative computational technique used to estimate the CS compression profile parameters.

To start the iterative computational procedure, the experimental data of the SF and the corresponding applied pressure from the simulator were used as input. The procedure required an initial estimate of yo,, and Kes to perform the first iteration. The objective function employed for the convergence of the iterative process was the same of the one used for estimating the Johanson model parameter, utilizing a MLE approach. The minimization function used is again the fminunc Matlab® solver, where the tolerance was set equal to 10°. Once the optimal value of Yo. and Kes were estimated, their 95% confidence intervals were computed as described in Section §3.4.2, hence using the Hessian matrix that the fminunc Matlab® solver gave as output.

3.6 Proposed transfer methodology using mass correction factor

=== Page 54 - main_text ===
This section represents the core of this Thesis, in which the proposed transfer methodology is explained in detail. The term "transfer" refers to the process of establishing a relation between the two distinct compression profiles, allowing for the conversion of one into the other. The proposed method is based on the mass correction factor methodology, which effectively explains the differences between the pressure exerted by the compactor simulator and the one estimated for the roller compactor, as presented in Section §2.2.

estimated for the roller compactor, as presented in Section §2.2.

The identified methodology consists of two major stages. Initially, during the development stage, the methodology was formulated and refined using historical datasets coming from RC and CS experimental campaigns, as depicted in Figure 3.8.

In this stage, which also includes a preliminary compression profile analysis, an understanding was achieved regarding how the pressure differences between the RC and CS compression profiles can be explained by the mass correction factor theory. Then, the proposed approach is built using the available experimental data, ensuring the development of a model that faithfully and comprehensively explains the observed phenomena. The development phase is composed by the calibration process and subsequent validation of the calibrated methodology. The execution of these two steps is explained in the following sections.

developed transfer methodology, all the necessary information is obtained to characterize the material's compaction behaviour on the RC without requiring direct experiments on it. Through the information obtained, it is then possible to set the RC in the most optimal way to obtain the desired product.

3.6.1 Development stage

=== Page 56 - main_text ===
The development phase is visually represented through a block diagram in Figure 3.8. The available powder mixtures were tested on both the RC and the CS to develop the transfer methodology. On the CS, different SF values of the ribblets were obtained at various adjusted pressures to estimate the two compression profile parameters, Yo. and Kcs, for each powder blend, as described in Section §3.5. Similarly, the same materials were tested on the RC to obtain various SF values at various combinations of specific roller force and roll gap. The Johanson model parameter values, as explained in Section §3.4, were then determined for each material. With the Yo, and Kec parameters available, the pressures exerted for each combination of machine parameters P"g, were estimated, enabling the construction of RC compression profiles.

=== Page 56 - main_text ===
The mass correction factor theory, as explained in Section §2.2, can now be applied. This theory allows linking the different pressures of the two equipment to the same SF values. Specifically, the study was focused on determining the values of fo required to equalize the different pressures for each ribbon SF obtained during the experimental campaign on the RC. The objective was to develop a relation that utilizes the mass correction factor to explain the differences between the two compression profiles for all powder mixtures during calibration. Subsequently, the relation could be applied when only the CS compression profile will be available at the usage stage, thereby enabling the construction of a virtual RC compression profile. The term "virtual" is employed to denote the Johanson model constructed using the CS experimental data and the mass correction factor transfer methodology, rather than relying on the RC experimental results. As a result, a model describing the behaviour of this material on roll compaction can be established without the need for an experimental campaign on the RC. The final step of the development phase was to derive an algebraic expression for fo that established the relationship between Pcs and Pyg,. This expression was obtained through calibration using available datasets, and the remaining datasets was used for validation purposes.

The calibration requires the definition of a function expressing fo. In existing literature, fy have been expressed as a constant function fy = const., which is independent of powder blend compositions, material properties and machine operating variables (Bi et al., 2014; So et al., 2021). The most suitable expression for f) will be designed based on the experimental results of this Thesis. At this stage, the expression will be represented just as fp = f(B,x), where B represents the vector of numerical parameters to be estimated during calibration, and x denotes the input variables, such as machine settings, that fg may depend on. To determine the pressure required for the CS to achieve the same relative densities for each measured ribbon SF, the values of Vri are projected onto the CS compression profile by inverting (2.15):

The objective is to achieve a transfer that results in the closest possible values of the calculated Posi to those of Pcs ;, thereby obtaining the closer overlapping between the corrected RC and CS compression profiles. An optimisation computational procedure is used to accomplish this, with the objective function, based on the MLE approach, that must be minimised:

3.6.3 Validation

=== Page 58 - main_text ===
Once the model has been calibrated and thus the function of fg has been numerically defined, the methodology can be validated using new datasets that were not part of the calibration datasets. Similarly to the calibration stage, also for the validation both RC and CS are required. The aim of the validation is to prove if and how effectively the calibrated methodology performs the transfer between the CS an RC compression profile for a new powder mixture. The validation procedures that have been adopted is depicted in Figure 3.12.

The initial step involves utilizing the dataset acquired during the experimental campaign on the CS to estimate the values of Yo,, and Kes. Using the calibrated expression of the mass correction factor and incorporating the obtained values of Yo, and K¢s, the virtual Johanson model parameters, namely 7p, and Krc, are derived. Once the values of Yorc and Rac are obtained they can be utilized in two ways for validation purposes:

=== Page 59 - main_text ===
Machine settings prediction: The Johanson model is inverted and, using the Yr values, the values of the machine settings to be set to obtain the same SF are determined, according to the model with the fo, and Kec parameters. As multiple combinations of specific roll forces and roll gaps can lead to same values of the ribbon SF, the roll gaps have been fixed to the experimentally implemented ones. Additionally, specific roller fractions are typically set to values with one decimal place. Therefore, the calculated values are rounded to the first significant figure to fit this practical constraint. Then, a comparison is made between the specific roll forces used in the experimental setup and the calculated ones.

3.6.4 Usage stage

=== Page 60 - main_text ===
If the developed model consistently demonstrates satisfactory and reliable performance across various powder mixtures, it can make a significant contribution to accelerating pharmaceutical tablet development. The application of the proposed transfer methodology during its usage stage is illustrated by the block flow diagram of Figure 3.9.

=== Page 60 - main_text ===
The investigation of a new pharmaceutical powder mixture will involve conducting an experimental campaign solely on the CS. The resulting experimental data will then be used to compute the values of Yo. and Ks. The latter will be used in conjunction with the correlation of the mass correction factor developed during the development stage to obtain the virtual Johanson model parameter values. These estimated parameters will be incorporated into the inverted Johanson model to determine the optimal RC machine settings SRF°@'", S°*'", to be implemented to obtain the desired ribbon SF, as desired by the operators.

=== Page 60 - main_text ===
If the transfer methodology demonstrates its effectiveness and reliability, it has the potential to completely replace the need to conduct experimental campaigns on the roller compactor. This would lead to significant savings in terms of materials and costs required for these experimental campaigns, while also accelerating the overall characterisation and process modelling timeline.

Conversely, Compound B exhibits significantly wider confidence intervals in relation to the absolute values of the associated parameters. This indicates that the true value of the Johanson parameters for this powder blend is expected to lie in a broader range of values, making the estimated values of Yop, and Kpc affected by a stringer uncertainty.

=== Page 63 - main_text ===
Figure 4.1 illustrates the RC compression profiles for each powder mixture analyzed in this thesis, built utilizing the results presented in Table 4.1. The compression profiles of the analyzed powder mixtures exhibit significant differences. Among them, Formulation 3, which resulted to be the most compressible material, shows a steep curve describing the relationship between SF and applied pressure. On the other hand, Compound B, which presents the highest compressibility constant (always considering the confidence intervals), displays a flatter curve. This suggests that, for Compound B, achieving higher ribbon SFs requires higher pressures, resulting in the need for either higher specific roll forces or narrower roll gaps to be adjusted during roll compaction operations. A distinctive characteristic of compound C is its ability to achieve high ribbon SF even at low pressures, obtainable by setting low specific roller forces and high roll gaps. This phenomenon is mathematically represented by the higher values observed for its pre-exponential parameter Yo as presented in Table 4.1.

Among the powder mixes, Compound B has the highest average intra-run variability value. This, coupled with the extremely high intra-run variability of the edge treatment levels, as shown in Figure 4.1.f, contributes to the significant uncertainty in estimating its parameters. Finally, the goodness of fit of the Johanson model was assessed by estimating the R? values in calibration for each powder mixture. In addition, the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) in calibration, between the calculated and experimental ribbon SFs, were

examined to assess the model capability to represent the roll compaction process. The maximum relative error, max(RE), is another metric used in this Thesis to evaluate the performance of the models. This metric represents the highest value between the relative errors of measured and calculated values of the SF. Its relevance is heightened by GSK's setting of a critical threshold of 10%.

The Johanson model demonstrates excellent results of the diagnostic parameter for the four placebo formulations. However, for the active powder blends, these values decrease due to the significant intra-run and process variability observed in the datasets from sample runs conducted at the same machine settings. This conclusion is also visible in Figure 4.1.e, 4.1.f and 4.1.g, where vertical clusters of experimental data at the same pressure values are present. Nevertheless, the relative and absolute errors of the SF still remain within acceptable values. With the compressibility constant values established, the nip angle values for each powder mixture can be derived using (2.12). The resulting values, computed across different roll gaps, are reported in Table 4.4.

4.1.2 Compactor simulator compression profile

=== Page 67 - main_text ===
The values of Yo, and Kes were estimated for all powder mixtures used in this Thesis by applying the iterative computational procedure described in Section §3.5. To assess potential variations caused by different pieces of equipment and diameter sizes, parameter estimation was conducted for each material CS dataset presented in Section §3.3. It is important to keep in mind that the initial two number digits within the dataset ID correspond to the diameter of the punches in millimetres. The resulting parameter values and 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 4.5.

Overall, the estimation of the ¥o,., and Kes parameters is more accurate than those of the RC. In fact, the SF data more closely follow the empirical power law trend of the SF with respect the applied pressure. Furthermore, when different punch sizes are considered, the estimated parameter values of the same powder blend show small deviations. These discrepancies may arise from the differences in geometry, where different punches and filling chamber diameter, leads to distinct ratios between volumes and contact surfaces. Consequently, such differences could result in different wall effects between the two configurations. Also, such differences may be determined by different experimental pressure ranges taken into consideration. In fact, as the applied pressure approaches very high levels, the SF values tend to converge towards the value of 1, resulting in a flattened compression profile, hence an increase in the value of the compressibility constant. Figure 4.3 shows the compression profiles for each powder mixture dataset analyzed in this Thesis, built utilizing the results presented in Table 4.5.

Also, in the case of the CS compression profiles, the reported curves present significant differences among the different powder blends. However, it is worth to notice that the empirical relationship, i.e., the power law function, proposed by Johanson (1964) describes accurately the behaviour of the pharmaceutical powders that undergo compression. The estimation of Yo... and Kes from the CS21-CB dataset yields a wide 95% confidence intervals, and this is because of the datapoint clustering due to the narrow pressure range explored during its experimental campaign.

4.1.3 Compression profiles comparison

=== Page 69 - main_text ===
The current objective is to investigate the differences between compression profiles derived from the CS and those obtained from the RC. From a mathematical perspective, this means comparing the different values of the values of yg and K obtained from distinct pieces of equipment. To ensure consistency and comparability in this analysis, the CS dataset utilized in this comparison analysis were the ones obtained from the experimental campaigns performed on the Phoenix® with the 10mm tooling diameter. This specific piece of equipment was employed to investigate all the materials examined in this case study, with the exception of compound C. This approach enables us to make meaningful comparisons of compaction profiles, as we are considering datasets generated using the same piece of equipment, similar

Compound C is not taken into account at this stage because its CS dataset was obtained with a different piece of equipment and with different punches profile.

The results show a consistent pattern across all seven powder blends: whatever the ribbon SF value, the compression profile constructed from the simulator consistently underestimates the pressure required for the same SF, in the RC. This finding aligns with the existing literature, which shows similar results (Reynolds et al., 2010; Toson et al., 2019). These differences can be mathematically explained by differences in the 7p and K values used to characterize the same powder mixture on the two pieces of equipment. To better visualize the numerical differences in the parameters, their values, along with the 95% confidence intervals, are graphically reported, for each powder blend, in Figure 4.5.

The comparison of Yg and K values indicates that, with the exception of compound B, the compactor simulator estimates greater values for both parameters than the RC. Compound B exhibits a different behaviour in the compactor simulator where both yp and K values are larger. However, it is important to highlight that compound B has extremely large confidence intervals, and most importantly much more uncertain. An interesting result from the comparative analysis of parameter values in Figure 4.4 is the particular sequence in which the parameters appear for each powder blend. Notably, if we consider a trend line that includes the data points for each piece of equipment, a significant congruence can be observed. Specifically, the sequence of parameters on the CS follows as: 3, 4, 2, A, 1, B; while the sequence of parameters on the RC is: 3, 4, 2, A, B, 1. The sole discrepancy is found in compound B; however, as previously mentioned, it exhibits criticality in the estimated parameter values.

=== Page 71 - main_text ===
Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show that the experimental results acquired from various pieces of compaction equipment differ significantly. Consequently, it is impractical to directly employ the estimated values of Yo, and Kcs to characterize a powder mixture on the RC. To support this claim, the Johanson model was applied to each powder mixture using parameters estimated by the simulator. The resulting diagnostic outcomes of these implemented models are displayed in Table 4.6.

=== Page 71 - main_text ===
It is evident that models calibrated with parameters estimated by the CS data are unsuitable for characterizing roll compaction operations of pharmaceutical powders. This holds true for all powder mixtures under analysis. In summary, this Section highlights that the transfer methodology that has to be employed ultimately must leads to lower values of Yop, and Kc parameters compared to those obtained from the CS.

Figure 4.6. Mass correction factor values estimated for each RC experimental data for: (a) Formulation 1; (b) Formulation 2, (c) Formulation 3, (d) Formulation 4, (e) Compound A, (f) Compound B.

=== Page 73 - main_text ===
This finding contradicts the approach suggested by Bi et al. (2014) and So et al. (2021), who proposed using a constant value for the correction at any machine setting combinations, and hence at any pressure (Bi et al., 2014; So et al., 2021). The observed linear increase in this trend with applied pressure is physically reasonable. This is because the parameter fj represents the fraction of mass delivered at the minimum roll gap, which is influenced by particles velocity gradients. When higher pressure is applied by the rollers, the particles become less loose in the nip region. Consequently, a larger fraction of powder is transported from the nip angle to the minimum roll gap.

4.2.1 Calibration

=== Page 73 - main_text ===
The initial focus on developing the proposed transfer mechanism was the identification of the specific CS and RC datasets. It was decided to create an initial model employing as calibration datasets the ones of the four placebo formulations, i.e., RC-F1, CS10-F1, RC-F2, CS10-F2, RC-F3, CS10-F3, RC-F4 and CS10-F4. or validation purposes, the datasets of the two active compounds, i.e., RC-CA, CS10-CA, RC-CB and CS10-CB, were used. This decision was made

on purpose, to stress and properly test the transfer methodology limits. As explained in Section §3.1, excipients possess excellent flowability and compressibility properties, while the presence of APIs in the blends tends to compromise these properties. Therefore, if the model, calibrated based on the results from placebo formulations, manages to achieve satisfactory outcomes even for active mixtures, it would indicate an additional level of validation. As a result, the proposed methodology reliability and possible usefulness for future powder mixtures under development operations, will be strengthened.

=== Page 74 - main_text ===
The first stage in building the model entails choosing and creating an expression for the mass correction factor f(B,x), as discussed in Section §3.6.2. In light of the findings observed in Section §4.1.4, the selected methodology should formulate In fo as a linear function of the logarithm of the rolls pressure:

=== Page 74 - main_text ===
Info = 2, + B2 IN Prax "

=== Page 74 - main_text ===
where £8, and £ represent the two coefficients to be estimated through calibration using experimental data. Their values must be determined to align the estimated pressure corrections for the RC as closely as possible with those for the CS, according to the calibration procedure discussed in Section §3.6.2. Importantly, it should be noted that the sets of experimental data points from the RC are not uniform across the four datasets. Specifically, during the experimental campaign for Formulation 1, five runs were executed, while Formulations 2, 3, and 4 each involved eight runs. each. Consequently, during calibration, the contribution of Formulation | to the calculation of the objective function (3.22) was weighted, i.e., multiplied by a coefficient, to make it comparable with the others. This approach guarantees that the incorporation of compression profiles from all formulations have equivalent significance in the model calibration process. Table 4.7 presents the calibrated values of the parameters of the mass correction factor expression, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

=== Page 74 - main_text ===
Furthermore, the correction of the RC pressure values of the experimental data, yielded using the calibrated values of 8, and fp, is visualized in Figure 4.7, where the corrected datapoints are represented by open dots.

=== Page 75 - main_text ===
The corrected pressure values demonstrate a remarkable similarity to the compression profiles generated by the compactor simulator. This consistency is noticeable for all four placebo formulations, highlighting the effectiveness of using a single expression for the mass correction factor. To numerically assess the differences observed during calibration, the mean absolute and relative errors, between pressures of the corrected RC data and their projection on the CS profiles, were computed for each formulation. These results are reported in Table 4.8.

Formulation 3 has larger pressure errors, which are mostly due to the negative influence of the data point at the upper treatment level. While the relative errors may appear significant, their impact on the calculation of the SF is relatively minor.

4.2.2 Validation

=== Page 76 - main_text ===
The validation of the calibrated model is presented, involving the use of Compounds A and B datasets. The procedure starts with the gathering of Yo,, and Kes values from the CS experimental data, as explained in Section §3.6.3. Their values are then employed to establish the virtual parameters of the Johanson model 79,,. and Kc, using the calibrated relationship for the mass correction factor. Due to the formulation determined for fo = f (8, x), this step is straightforward. Starting from the relation defining the compression profile of the CS, it results:

=== Page 76 - main_text ===
whe Y=YocsFcs (4.3)

=== Page 76 - main_text ===
As discussed in Section §2.2, a relation is established between the pressure of the CS and that of the RC based on the definition of the mass factor. Combining (4.3) to (2.24), the SF can be expressed as function of the peak pressure exerted by the rolls:

Both (4.7) and (4.8) exhibit an important feature: the virtual Johanson model parameters that they yield are smaller than those acquired from the CS. This particular aspect is very crucial in achieving the greatest effectiveness of the compression profiles transfer. Had the relation suggested by Bi et al.

In this instance, only the pre-consolidation relative density would be modified, while the compressibility constant of the CS would remain unchanged. However, such an approach would yield a suboptimal model, especially when dealing with highly compressible powder mixtures. The performance of the transfer methods can be evaluated throughout the validation after acquiring Yop, and Krc as per (4.7) and (4.8). This assessment investigates its capacity to predict both the SF and machine parameters. The predicted results will be compared to the actual outcomes obtained during the RC experimental campaigns. For a more detailed analysis of the results obtained, the validations will be presented separately for Compound A and Compound B.

Section §4.1.2 reported the values of the 10 mm CS parameters Yo. and Kes form Compound A, which yielded values of 0.280 and 4.815 for Yo, and Kgc, respectively. By utilizing these computed values along with all input data, as illustrated in Figure 3.12.a, the Johanson model is solved in its direct form. This procedure allows for the model to compute the calculated SFs yga'e, for each combination of experimentally implemented machine parameters. The comparison between these calculated values, yg“, and their corresponding experimental counterparts, Vp? is carried out using the parity plot shown in Figure 4.8.a. The plot also includes error bands representing relative errors of 5% and 10%, enhancing the visualization of the datapoints distribution.

data, display an error greater than 5%. The highest reported relative error is 7.4%. Furthermore, it is important to highlight the considerable variability observed in the measured SF values. Even when the same combination of machine parameters is used, resulting in identical calculated SFs, the measured values show significant variability. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the virtual Johanson model, which was developed primarily on the CS and transfer methods, accurately characterises the compaction behaviour of compound A on the RC. This conclusion is supported by the remarkable similarity between the diagnostic results of the virtual Johanson model and the Johanson model, as shown in Table 4.8.

The validation method now involves predicting machine parameters, as detailed in Section §3.6.3 and illustrated in Figure 3.12.b. The input data in this scenario comes from the experimental RC dataset, which includes Yr values and the corresponding adjusted minimum roll gaps that were applied. The specific roll forces required to precisely produce the values of Yr are calculated by solving the inverse of the Johanson model using fo, and Kpc.

employed during experiments and those calculated. Once again, the datapoints exhibit an homogeneous distribution of both positive and negative errors. The mean absolute error between experimentally implemented and calculated specific roll forces is 0.80 kN/cm. To summarise, the findings in this section highlight the greater accuracy of the prediction outcomes resulting from the proposed transfer methodology applied to Compound A. The application of this methodology at the usage stages would have successfully simulated this specific powder mixture without the requirement for an RC experimental campaign. Consequently 18 kg of material would have been saved, assuming 2.5 kg of powder blend for every 4 runs as reported by GSK. This huge amount becomes even more significant when considering the scarcity and cost of pharmaceutical compounds during their development stages.

As can be seen from Figure 4.10.a, one single data point exceeds the 10% threshold error band. While seven of the total thirty experiments, accounting for 23% of the dataset, have relative errors greater than 5%. This mismatch can be traced to both the inaccuracy of the developed virtual Johanson model and the significant variability inherent in the experimental campaign of Compound B, as reported in Table 4.2. Similarly, in the parity plot illustrated in Figure 4.10.b, which highlights the errors in specific roll forces, the model still demonstrates its capability to offer a reasonable prediction of the required machine parameters to achieve the targeted ribbon

The discrepancy in parameter values is significant; however, the remaining outcomes of the model exhibit no excessive fluctuations. This is due to the high confidence interval values of Compound B parameter estimation.

Figure 4.11. RC and virtual RC compression profiles comparison for Compound B.

=== Page 80 - main_text ===
Although the two compression profiles exhibit marked dissimilarities, both capture the compaction behaviour of Compound B on the RC. It's important to consider that the estimated pressure values, the x-axis, for each test point are influenced by the parameter Kec utilized. Consequently, if the smaller Kc, i.e., Kc is employed, the RC datapoints in Figure 4.11 would shift leftward, aligning more closely with the compression profile of the virtual Johanson model.

=== Page 80 - main_text ===
From both Figure 4.10 and 4.11, another issue within the RC dataset of compound B is revealed. Specifically, two experimental points appear to be outliers. In fact, these datapoints, which are found at the higher and lower treatment levels, presents a SF of approximately 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. This is significant since the two treatment levels have radically different roller-

specific forces, namely 3.5 and 10.0 kN/cm, while keeping the same minimum roll gap. If these two experiments, which are likely outliers, were excluded, the results of the transfer methodology would improve. In light of this, a scenario is presented wherein both the Johanson model and the validation of the virtual Johanson model are developed by omitting these two anomalous datapoints. The results are reported in Table 4.10.

Table 4.10 and Figure 4.12 exemplify the impact of these two data points on the transfer outcomes. Even without excluding the two supposed outliers, the results of the transfer are decent and comparable with the Johanons model. But, by excluding them, a substantial improvement is experienced in the performance of the proposed transfer methodology. In conclusion also for Compound B the proposed transfer methodology obtains accurate results in validation and would have been suitable for its implementation in its usage stage procedures. Just as observed with Compound A, in this particular scenario a total of around 6 kg of material may have been saved from the RC experimental campaign.

methodology would perform when data from different datasets are used. In particular, the performance of the transfer methodology is investigated when "mixed datasets," i.e., datasets containing distinct experimental results from several compaction simulators (CS) with varying punch sizes, are used. These "mixed datasets" contain the same number of experiments as their 10 mm datasets counterparts. Within them, 50% of the observations are randomly selected from the 10 mm CS dataset, while the remaining 50% are drawn from either the 18 mm CS datasets (Formulations 2, 3, and 4) or the 21.8 mm CS dataset (Compounds A and B). This scenario was selected based on the practical experience gathered during the course of this Thesis project. It is not uncommon for experimental equipment to experience issues and become unavailable as a result. Different equipment layouts are frequently used, and having a model that can be applied to data coming from different instruments setup can provide additional value. The validation processes presented in this Section are the same as those described in Section §3.6.3 and implemented in Section §4.2.2. The key difference is the use of different CS datasets as the initial points. As a result, the derived parameters Yo. and Kes will differ intrinsically, resulting in differences in the Johanson virtual model parameters Yop, and Kc. In this analysis for Compound B, the entirety of the RC dataset is incorporated into the validation process,

=== Page 84 - main_text ===
The obtained transfer outcomes are really accurate over the entire variety of powder mixtures. However, in the case of Formulation 4 and the Compound A, there is a slightly decrease in performance where an heterogeneity of the error distributions can be noted in their parity plots. Such results were reasonably anticipated, as discussed in Section §4.1.2, where it was evident that the parameters yo. and Kcs estimated using CS with varying diameters exhibited minimal disparity. Nonetheless, the results of our investigation clearly demonstrate that the proposed transfer methodology is still usable, although with some caution when working with data from other CS datasets.

=== Page 84 - main_text ===
This finding highlights a further advantage of the proposed transfer methodology, which contributes to its intrinsic value in line with its core objective of accelerating tablet production development stages. In circumstances where CS data might be scarce, the creation of a "mixed" dataset becomes a viable option, facilitating the augmentation of available data, broadening the experimental space and reducing the uncertainty associated with evaluated CS parameters.

4.3 Mix transfer model

=== Page 85 - main_text ===
A new model is introduced in consideration of the results demonstrated in the preceding section, where the effectiveness of the model calibrated using the four placebo formulations in the validation phase was established. This model was calibrated using all available powder mixes, with the exception of Compound C because of its criticalities. Following this approach, a model will be developed that includes calibration from six powder blends, allowing for an analysis of a wider variety of material characteristics. This will result in the achievement of a final transfer function that is simultaneously established across all powder blends, thereby obtaining the most optimal transfer possible for each. Inevitably, doing so will reduce the model's ability to describe the required transfer for placebo formulations. However, it is expected to improve performance when active formulations are taken into account.

=== Page 85 - main_text ===
The datasets employed for the calibration of this ultimate model are: RC-F1, CS10-F1, RC-F2, CS10-F2, RC-F3, CS10-F3, RC-F4, CS10-F4, RC-CA, CS10-CA, RC-CB and CS10-CB. The two presumed outliers of the RC Compound B dataset are removed in this analysis. Again, in light of the results presented in Figure 4.6, a linear function was utilised to express the mass correction factor in relation to the pressure exerted by the rollers. During the calibration phase, the influence of each powder mixture on the calculation of the objective function was weighed according to all the corresponding experimental data points, similarly to the placebo model. This ensured that the significance of each powder blend contribution was aligned, avoiding any undue impact from large RC datasets the one Compound A, with its eighty-seven experiments. The results of the calibration so performed are presented in Table 4.12, with the numerical values of the two parameters of the linear relationship and the respective confidence intervals.

The model, in view of the reported MAE demonstrates to be effective for all the analysed powder mixtures. In conclusion the results reported in Table 4.12 represent the value of the linear function of fo proposed to be used in the future usage stage of the methodology, to retrieve the values of fy, and Rac, starting from 79 cs and Kcs, and applying (4.7) and (4.8). The corrected pressure values from the RC data show a remarkable closeness with the CS compression patterns. This notable agreement exists throughout the four placebo formulations and the two active compounds, demonstrating the effectiveness of using a single expression for the mass correction factor. Mean absolute and relative errors were computed for each material to quantify the differences observed during the calibration procedure between the pressures of the CS profile pressures and the ones of the corrected RC data. The results are reported in Table 4.13.

4.4 Compound C analysis

=== Page 87 - main_text ===
As previously discussed, Compound C was excluded from the analysis in Section §4.2 due to the distinct nature of its available CS dataset, obtained from a different piece of equipment and employing varying pressure application modality. The objective of this section is to investigate the applicability and results of expanding the performed previous analysis to include Compound C as well. Compound C also stands out because of its distinctive attribute of containing a high API content (about 87% w/w). Pre-consolidation relative densities and compressibility constants for both RC and CS datasets have already been estimated and reported, as in Sections §4.1.1 and §4.1.2. The resulting compression profiles are together reported and in Figure 4.14.

Again, the CS compression profile underestimates the pressure necessary to obtain the same ribbon solid fraction in comparison to the RC compression profile. In fact, both Yo... and Kes present values greater compared to Yop, and Kgc. This result aligns with the findings from all other powder mixtures investigated in this Thesis, except for Compound B.

The investigation is now on establishing how the calibrated transfer methodology with all the materials applies to the experimental results obtained for Compound C. Employing (4.7) and (4.8), virtual Johanson parameter values of 0.360 and 5.567 are obtained, respectively. Subsequently, these values are utilized to solve the Johanson model, both directly and inversely, yielding calculated ribbon SF values and calculated specific roll forces. The resulting comparisons with the experimental ones are visually presented through parity plots in Figure 4.15.

The results are worse in this instance, where 14 datapoints, of the total 23, presents a relative error greater than 5%., while there are 4 datapoints with a relative error greater than 10. Additionally, the error distribution is skewed, with predominantly positive residuals, where Vr is greater than y£“"“ for all cases except for one. These negative outcomes are also present in Figure 4.15.b, where machine parameter predictions fail to align precisely with the experimental ones and are not homogeneous distributed. The parameters and the diagnostic results of Johanson models employing virtual parameters and those derived from experimental data are presented in Table 4.12:

Also the model diagnostic results of these two models differ significantly. This discrepancy is evident when the compression profiles of the Johanson and virtual models are compared visually in Figure 4.16.

Figure 4.16. RC and virtual RC compression profiles comparison for Compound C.

=== Page 89 - main_text ===
The application of the transfer methodology to the CS curve yields a compression profile that

=== Page 89 - main_text ===
consistently overestimates the pressure in comparison to the RC profile across the entire range of experimental pressures. Consequently, the SFs computed by the virtual Johanson model are predicted to be higher than the corresponding experimental values, as previously discussed. Considering the entirety of the presented findings, the transfer methodology is not satisfactory and acceptable in the case of Compound C. The outcomes point to two potential reasons for Compound C anomalous performances. A possible reason could be the use of different piece of equipment for investigating the material compaction behaviour on the CS. Aside from the differences in machinery, the manner in which pressure was applied differs from previous procedures used to the material used to calibrate and validate the transfer model. Alternatively, the composition of Compound C might be the root cause. Compound C, in particular, has large API percentages, which could potentially lead to divergent flow properties and compaction behaviours. As a result, this instance needs the inclusion of alternate transfer model values in order to provide a more precise representation of this compound's characteristics.

=== Page 89 - main_text ===
Hence, in order to properly evaluate the aforementioned conclusions, an experimental campaign of Compound C on the Phoenix® CS with a 10 mm diameter and employing punch compression through a sinusoidal profile should be performed. Subsequently, the proposed and calibrated transfer methodology could be applied to these experimental outcomes. Following the suggested validation procedure, it could be possible to determine whether the results of the virtual Johanson model outperform the data shown in Table 4.12.

=== Page 89 - main_text ===
If the results improve, aligning more closely with the Johanson model derived from experimental data, a plausible inference could be drawn: the proposed transfer methodology is effective even for powder blends with high API content. However, it's noteworthy that the

Hence, a fairly detailed demonstration of the effect of different excipient composition on the estimation of Johanson parameters can now be developed. The initial step was to examine at a binary excipient blend, specifically MCC PH 102 and Anhydrous Lactose. Figure 4.17 shows the values of Yop, and Kpc, along with their respective confidence intervals, as function of the weight fraction of the lactose in the blends.

Powder blends characterized by elevated levels of mannitol and lactose, both of which exhibiting brittle deformation tendencies, present elevated values of yop. and Krc. Conversely, a higher content of MCC, which is characterised by its plastic behaviour, results in lower values of the Johnson model parameters. The observed trend indicates that as the MCC concentration of a blend increases, the estimated pressure required to produce the same ribbon SF decreases in comparison to blends with elevated levels of mannitol or lactose. The difference depends on the different compression profiles given by Yor, and Krc, where a lower value of Kp results in a steeper curve.

=== Page 92 - main_text ===
Furthermore, Figures 4.17 and 4.18 indicate that the relations between the values of Yop. and Krc and the excipient weight fractions are not linear. Indeed, up to 50% MCC compositions, the values of both Johanson model parameters maintain a degree of proximity between powder blends. However, as MCC concentrations decrease further, there is a significant increase in the values of Yop, and Kpc.

The objective of this thesis was to provide a methodology able to explain and relate the discrepancies between the empirical results obtained from a compactor simulator and a roller compactor. The method ought to determine a correlation between the different pressures observed across the two pieces of equipment, for the same values of ribbon solid fraction. This methodology would enable gathering all necessary information required for the properly set the RC operating conditions, based solely on the CS experimental data. Consequently, significant material and cost savings can be achieved during the drug development process.

=== Page 93 - main_text ===
In order to reach these targets, the study has been carried out as follows.

=== Page 93 - main_text ===
First, the roll compaction process was modelled using Johanson (1965) model. The calibration of the Johanson model parameters was carried out for each material utilised in this study, based on the available experimental results. The parameter estimation was conducted by employing a maximum likelihood estimation approach. RC compression profiles were defined using the two Johanson model parameters. In a similar manner, the CS compression profiles were also established. Second, a transfer methodology was developed to account for the differences between CS and RC compression profiles. This methodology is based on the mass correction factor fo theory (Bi et al., 2014). Based on the obtained findings, an algebraic material- independent relationship between fo and the roller pressure was developed. The values of the two coefficients in this relationship were determined through a calibration procedure utilising experimental data obtained from four different placebo powder formulations. The model was subsequently validated by employing two active powder compounds, resulting in very accurate property predictions. Third, the model was validated using CS datasets acquired with punches of different sizes than the calibration data. The validation findings once again shown a high level of accuracy in terms of prediction. This section of the study demonstrates the applicability of the methodology in emergency scenarios, utilising data obtained from multiple experimental campaigns. Fourth, all the six materials were used to calibrate a final model, with the aim to be implemented in the operational stage to reduce materials consumption during drug developing phases. In conclusion, the analysis of a seventh material was conducted employing the transfer methodology. In this specific case, the predicted outcomes are deemed unsatisfactory. However, this may be due to the difference modality and equipment employed to gather the CS

=== Page 93 - main_text ===
experimental data compared to calibration.

One of the primary challenges encountered in this Thesis was related to the definition and coding of the parameter estimate algorithm for the Johanson model. The latter was executed using an iterative optimisation process in Matlab®. Later, the optimal methodology for linking

RC and CS experimental data had to be determined. The most effective technique has been identified in the mass correction factor theory, which is also supported by physical concepts. Some issues have been identified during the analysis of the RC dataset of material, whereby the significant variability of the experimental data has resulted in a considerable level of uncertainty in the analysis.

=== Page 94 - main_text ===
The validation analysis focused both on the analysis of the predictive results in terms of both the ribbon solid fraction and the machine parameters. In both instances, the errors observed between the estimated and experimental values were found to be limited and uniformly distributed around zero. All errors relative to the predicted ribbon solid fraction were determined to be within the maximum threshold of relative error, which was set at 10%. Given the composition of the four placebo formulations, an analysis of the effect of excipient concentrations on Johanson parameter values was performed. The study revealed that large amounts of anhydrous lactose and mannitol, both characterised as brittle materials, lead to great values of them. Conversely, the higher the microcrystalline cellulose composition, the lower the Johanson parameter values.

=== Page 94 - main_text ===
One of the limits of the study is related to the fact that the proposed transfer methodology has been formulated as material independent. The values of parameters of the fo expression are determined by obtaining the best simultaneous transfer for all the calibration material. The effectiveness of this approach was shown to be significant across all six materials examined, exceeding the typical number of materials analysed in existing literature. This finding is noteworthy considering the significant variations in the compositions and characteristics of the powder mixtures. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the methodology employed in this work may not yield desirable results when applied to materials that exhibit a significantly distinct physical response across the two scales.

=== Page 94 - main_text ===
Hence, a potential opportunity to improve the proposed transfer method in the future would involve examining materials with physical compositions and properties beyond the six powder blends evaluated. Such an approach would enable the determination of the overall effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The execution of this implementation should follow the same procedure as the collection of the calibration experimental data, in order to avoid introducing additional variability caused by using different equipment or applying pressure in different modes. When investigate materials comparable to those discussed in this Thesis, it is suggested to proceed with the implementation of the methodology during the usage phase. This involves exclusively establishing the RC machine parameters based on the CS experimental results and the mass correction factor.
